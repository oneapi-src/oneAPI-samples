# `hello-vpp` Sample

This sample shows how to use the oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) to
perform simple video processing.

| Optimized for       | Description
|-------------------- | ----------------------------------------
| OS                  | Ubuntu* 20.04
| Hardware            | CPU: See [System Requirements](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/oneapi-video-processing-library-system-requirements.html)
|                     | GPU: Compatible with Intel® oneAPI Video Processing Library(oneVPL) GPU implementation, which can be found at https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneVPL-intel-gpu
| Software            | Intel® oneAPI Video Processing Library(oneVPL)
| What You Will Learn | How to use oneVPL to resize and change color format of a raw video file
| Time to Complete    | 5 minutes

Expected input/output formats:
* In: CPU=I420 (yuv420p color planes), GPU=NV12 color planes
* Out: BGRA color planes

## Purpose

This sample is a command line application that takes a file containing a raw
format video elementary stream as an argument. Using oneVPL, the application
processes it and writes the resized output to `out.raw` in BGRA raw video format.

Native raw frame input format: CPU=I420, GPU=NV12.

| Configuration     | Default setting
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------
| Target device     | CPU
| Input format      | I420
| Output format     | BGRA raw video elementary stream
| Output resolution | 640 x 480

### Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

## Building the `hello-vpp` Program

### On a Linux* System

Perform the following steps:

1. Install the prerequisite software. To build and run the sample you need to
   install prerequisite software and set up your environment:

   - Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit for Linux*
   - [CMake](https://cmake.org)

2. Set up your environment using the following command.
   ```
   source <oneapi_install_dir>/setvars.sh
   ```
   Here `<oneapi_install_dir>` represents the root folder of your oneAPI
   installation, which is `/opt/intel/oneapi/` when installed as root, and
   `~/intel/oneapi/` when installed as a normal user.  If you customized the
   installation folder, it is in your custom location.

3. Build the program using the following commands:
   ```
   cp $ONEAPI_ROOT/vpl/latest/examples .
   cd examples/hello/hello-vpp
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. Run the program with default arguments using the following command:
   ```
   cmake --build . --target run
   ```


## Running the Sample

### Application Parameters

The instructions given above run the sample executable with the argument
`-sw -i ${CONTENTPATH}/cars_128x96.i420 -w 128 -h 96`.


### Example Output

```
Implementation details:
  ApiVersion:           2.5
  Implementation type:  SW
  AccelerationMode via: NA
  Path: /opt/intel/oneapi/vpl/2021.6.0/lib/libvplswref64.so.1

Processing /home/test/intel_innersource/frameworks.media.onevpl.dispatcher/examples/hello/hello-vpp/content/cars_128x96.i420 -> out.raw
Processed 60 frames
```

You can find the 640x480 BGRA output file `out.raw` in the build directory.

You can display the output with a video player that supports raw streams such as
FFplay. You can use the following command to display the output with FFplay:

```
ffplay -video_size 640x480 -pixel_format bgra -f rawvideo out.raw
```

### Troubleshooting
If an error occurs, troubleshoot the problem using the Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits.
