# `hello-vpp` Sample

This sample shows how to use the oneAPI Video Processing Library (oneVPL) to
perform simple video processing using 2.x enhanced programming model APIs.

| Optimized for       | Description
|-------------------- | ----------------------------------------
| OS                  | Ubuntu* 20.04
| Hardware            | CPU: See [System Requirements](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/oneapi-video-processing-library-system-requirements.html)
|                     | GPU: Future Intel速 Graphics platforms supporting oneVPL 2.x API features 
| Software            | Intel速 oneAPI Video Processing Library(oneVPL)
| What You Will Learn | How to use oneVPL to resize and change color format of a raw video file
| Time to Complete    | 5 minutes

## Purpose

This sample is a command line application that takes a file containing a raw
format video elementary stream as an argument. Using oneVPL, the application
processes it and writes the resized output to `out.raw` in BGRA raw video format.

Native raw frame input format: CPU=I420, GPU=NV12.

| Configuration     | Default setting
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------
| Target device     | CPU
| Input format      | I420
| Output format     | BGRA raw video elementary stream
| Output resolution | 640 x 480

## Building the `hello-vpp` Program

### Include Files
The oneVPL include folder is located at these locations on your development system:
 - Windows: %ONEAPI_ROOT%\vpl\latest\include 
 - Linux: $ONEAPI_ROOT/vpl/latest/include

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel速 oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)


### On a Linux* System

Perform the following steps:

1. Install the prerequisite software. To build and run the sample, you need to
   install prerequisite software and set up your environment:

   - Intel速 oneAPI Base Toolkit for Linux*
   - [CMake](https://cmake.org)

2. Set up your environment using the following command.
   ```
   source <oneapi_install_dir>/setvars.sh
   ```
   Here `<oneapi_install_dir>` represents the root folder of your oneAPI
   installation, which is `/opt/intel/oneapi/` when installed as root, and
   `~/intel/oneapi/` when installed as a normal user.  If you customized the
   installation folder, it is in your custom location.

3. Build the program using the following commands:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```

4. Run the program using the following command:
   ```
   cmake --build . --target run
   ```
## Running the Sample

### Application Parameters

The instructions given above run the sample executable with the argument
`-i examples/content/cars_128x96.i420 128 96`.


### Example of Output

```
Implementation info
      version = 2.4
      impl = Software
Processing hello-vpp/../content/cars_128x96.i420 -> out.raw
Processed 60 frames

```

You can find the output file `out.raw` in the build directory, and its size is `640x480`.

You can display the output with a video player that supports raw streams such as
FFplay. You can use the following command to display the output with FFplay:

```
ffplay -video_size 640x480 -pixel_format bgra -f rawvideo out.raw
```
