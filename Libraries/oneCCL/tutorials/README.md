| Component | [oneCCL_Getting_Started](oneCCL_Getting_Started.ipynb) |This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to compile a oneCCL sample with different releases and how to port a oneCCL sample from CPU-only version to CPU&GPU version by using DPC++ via batch jobs on the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI (check below Notice)|
>  Notice : Please use Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI as the environment for jupyter notebook samples. \
Users can refer to [DevCloud Getting Started](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/) for using DevCloud \
Users can use JupyterLab from DevCloud via "One-click Login in", and download samples via "git clone" or the "oneapi-cli" tool \
Once users are in the JupyterLab with downloaded jupyter notebook samples, they can start following the steps without further installion needed.
You can also use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).
