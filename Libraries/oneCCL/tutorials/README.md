| Component | [oneCCL_Getting_Started](oneCCL_Getting_Started.ipynb) |This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to compile a oneCCL sample with different releases and how to port a oneCCL sample from CPU-only version to CPU&GPU version by using DPC++ via batch jobs on the Intel oneAPI DevCloud (check below Notice)|
>  Notice : Please use Intel oneAPI DevCloud as the environment for jupyter notebook samples. \
Users can refer to [DevCloud Getting Started](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/) for using DevCloud \
Users can use JupyterLab from DevCloud via "One-click Login in", and download samples via "git clone" or the "oneapi-cli" tool \
Once users are in the JupyterLab with downloaded jupyter notebook samples, they can start following the steps without further installion needed.
