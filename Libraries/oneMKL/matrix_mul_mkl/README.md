## Purpose

Matrix Multiplication uses oneMKL to multiply two large matrices.

This sample performs its computations on the default SYCL* device. You can set the `SYCL_DEVICE_TYPE` environment variable to `cpu` or `gpu` to select the device to use.


## Key Implementation Details

The oneMKL `blas::gemm` routine performs a generalized matrix multiplication operation. OneMKL BLAS routines support both row-major and column-major matrix layouts; this sample uses row-major layouts, the traditional choice for C++.

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see the
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

## Building the Matrix Multiplication with oneMKL Sample
> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Running Samples In Intel® DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/).


### On a Linux* System
Run `make` to build and run the sample.

You can remove all generated files with `make clean`.

### On a Windows* System
Run `nmake` to build and run the sample. `nmake clean` removes temporary files.

> **Warning**: On Windows, static linking with oneMKL currently takes a very long time due to a known compiler issue. This will be addressed in an upcoming release.

## Running the Matrix Multiplication with oneMKL Sample

### Example of Output
If everything is working correctly, the program will generate two input matrices and call oneMKL to multiply them. It will also compute the product matrix itself to verify the results from oneMKL.

```
./matrix_mul_mkl
Device: Intel(R) Gen9 HD Graphics NEO
Problem size:  A (600x1200) * B (1200x2400)  -->  C (600x2400)
Launching oneMKL GEMM calculation...
Performing reference calculation...
Results are accurate.
```

### Troubleshooting
If an error occurs, troubleshoot the problem using the Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits.
