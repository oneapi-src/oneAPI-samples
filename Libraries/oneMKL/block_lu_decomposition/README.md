# Block LU Decomposition Sample

Block LU Decomposition shows how to use the oneMKL library's BLAS and LAPACK functionality to solve a block tridiagonal linear equation.

## Purpose

Block LU Decomposition consists of two small applications (`factor.cpp` and `solve.cpp`). The factor step generates a block tridiagonal matrix, then performs a block LU factorization using oneMKL BLAS and LAPACK routines. The solver application uses this factorization to solve a linear system with the block tridiagonal matrix on the left-hand side. Both factoring and solving require several oneMKL routines. Some steps can be parallelized, while others must be ordered sequentially. The sample code shows how to inform oneMKL of the dependencies that exist between routines, using DPC++ events. The code uses pointer-based programming, with Unified Shared Memory (USM), throughout, which allows individual oneMKL routines to work on submatrices of the original matrices.

This sample will use the default DPC++ device. You can set the `SYCL_DEVICE_TYPE` environment variable to `cpu` or `gpu` to select the device to use.


## Key Implementation Details

This sample illustrates several important oneMKL routines: matrix multiplication, triangular solves from BLAS (`gemm`, `trsm`), and LU factorization (`getrf`) from LAPACK, as well as several other utility routines.

## Building the Block LU Decomposition Sample

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Run `make` to build and run the factor and solve programs. You can remove all generated files with `make clean`.

### On a Windows* System
Run `nmake` to build and run the sample. `nmake clean` removes temporary files.

## Running the Block LU Decomposition Sample

### Example of Output
If everything is working correctly, after building you will see output from both the `factor` and `solve` programs. Each includes an accuracy check at the end. The example output below shows a successful run, with very small floating-point error.
```
./factor
Testing accuracy of LU factorization with pivoting
of randomly generated block tridiagonal matrix
by calculating norm of the residual matrix.
||A - LU||_F/||A||_F = 3.65246e-16

./solve
Testing accuracy of solution of linear equations system
with randomly generated block tridiagonal coefficient
matrix by calculating ratios of residuals
to RHS vectors norms.
max_(i=1,...,nrhs){||ax(i)-f(i)||/||f(i)||} = 6.88457e-13
```
