# `Binomial` Sample

Binomial shows how to use Random Number Generator (RNG) functionality
available in Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL). It uses for
european options pricing using binomial options pricing model
for suitable randomly-generated portfolios.

## Purpose

The binomial options pricing model is widely used in financial markets.
It has a lot of computation after random numbers are generated.

The sample first generates a portfolio within given constraints using a uniform
distribution and a Philox-type generator provided by the oneMKL RNG API.

This sample performs its computations on the default SYCL* device. You can set
the `SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER` environment variable to `cpu` or `gpu` to select the device to use.

## Key Implementation Details

This sample illustrates how to create an RNG engine object (the source of
pseudo-randomness), a distribution object (specifying the desired probability
distribution), and finally generate the random numbers themselves.

In this sample, a Philox 4x32x10 generator is used. It is a lightweight
counter-based RNG well-suited for parallel computing.

This sample has pretty heavy kernel. It means that the kernel
contains a lot of computations.

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see the
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

## Building the Binomial Sample

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `$ bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - For Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or MacOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).


### Running Samples In Intel® DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, remember that you must specify the
compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode.
For more information see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide
(https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/).

### On a Linux* System
Run `make` to build the sample. Then run the sample calling generated execution file.

You can remove all generated files with `make clean`.

### On a Windows* System
Run `nmake` to build and run the sample programs. `nmake clean` removes temporary files.

#### Build a sample using Random Number Generation on Host
To use the RNG on host use `init_on_host=1`, e.g.
```
make init_on_host=1
```
for Linux* system or

```
nmake init_on_host=1
```

for Windows* System.

## Running the Binomial Sample
If everything is working correctly, the program will run the Binomial simulation.
After the simulation, results will be checked against the known true values
given by the Black-Scholes formula, and the absolute error is output.

Example of output:
```
$ ./binomial_sycl
