# Sparse Conjugate Gradient Sample

Sparse Conjugate Gradient shows how to use the oneMKL library's sparse linear algebra functionality to solve a sparse, symmetric linear system using the (preconditioned) conjugate gradient method.

## Purpose

Sparse Conjugate Gradient uses oneMKL's sparse linear algebra routines to solve a system of linear equations Ax = b, where the A matrix is symmetric and sparse. The symmetric Gauss-Seidel preconditioner is used to accelerate convergence.

This sample performs its computations on the default DPC++ device. You can set the `SYCL_DEVICE_TYPE` environment variable to `cpu` or `gpu` to select the device to use.


## Key Implementation Details

oneMKL sparse routines use a two-stage method where the sparse matrix is analyzed in preparation for subsequent calculations (the _optimize_ step). Sparse matrix-vector multiplication and triangular solves (`gemv` and `trsv`) are used to implement the main loop, along with vector routines from BLAS.

## Building the Sparse Conjugate Gradient Sample

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Run `make` to build and run the sample.

You can remove all generated files with `make clean`.

### On a Windows* System
Run `nmake` to build and run the sample. `nmake clean` removes temporary files.

## Running the Sparse Conjugate Gradient Sample

### Example of Output
If everything is working correctly, the example program will rapidly converge to a solution, and display the first few entries of the solution vector. The test will run in both single and double precision (if available on the selected device).
