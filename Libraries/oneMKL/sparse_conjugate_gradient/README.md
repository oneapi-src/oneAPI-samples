# `Sparse Conjugate Gradient` Sample

Sparse Conjugate Gradient shows how to use the oneMKL library's sparse linear algebra functionality to solve a sparse, symmetric linear system using the (preconditioned) conjugate gradient method.

For more information on oneMKL, and complete documentation of all oneMKL routines, see https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html.

## Purpose

Sparse Conjugate Gradient uses oneMKL's sparse linear algebra routines to solve a system of linear equations Ax = b, where the A matrix is symmetric and sparse. The symmetric Gauss-Seidel preconditioner is used to accelerate convergence.

This sample performs its computations on the default DPC++ device. You can set the `SYCL_DEVICE_TYPE` environment variable to `cpu` or `gpu` to select the device to use.


## Key Implementation Details

oneMKL sparse routines use a two-stage method where the sparse matrix is analyzed to prepare subsequent calculations (the _optimize_ step). Sparse matrix-vector multiplication and triangular solves (`gemv` and `trsv`) are used to implement the main loop, along with vector routines from BLAS.

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel速 oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel速 oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

## Building the Sparse Conjugate Gradient Sample

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).


### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel速 oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)


### On a Linux* System
Run `make` to build and run the sample.

You can remove all generated files with `make clean.`

### On a Windows* System
Run `nmake` to build and run the sample. `nmake clean` removes temporary files.

*Warning*: On Windows, static linking with oneMKL currently takes a very long time due to a known compiler issue. This will be addressed in an upcoming release.

## Running the Sparse Conjugate Gradient Sample

### Example of Output
If everything is working correctly, the example program will rapidly converge to a solution and display the solution vector's first few entries. The test will run in both single and double precision (if available on the selected device).
