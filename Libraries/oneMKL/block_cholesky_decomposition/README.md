# `Block Cholesky Decomposition` Sample

Block Cholesky Decomposition shows how to use the Intel® oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL) library's BLAS and LAPACK functionality to solve a symmetric, positive-definite block tridiagonal linear equation.

## Purpose

Block Cholesky Decomposition consists of two small applications (`factor.cpp` and `solve.cpp`). The factor step generates a block tridiagonal matrix, then performs a block Cholesky factorization using oneMKL BLAS and LAPACK routines. The solver application uses this factorization to solve a linear system with the block tridiagonal matrix on the left-hand side. Both factoring and solving require several oneMKL routines. Some steps can be parallelized, while others must be ordered sequentially.

The sample code shows how to inform oneMKL of the dependencies between routines using SYCL*-compliant events. The code uses pointer-based programming, with Unified Shared Memory (USM) throughout, which allows individual oneMKL routines to work on submatrices of the original matrices.

This sample will use the default SYCL device. You can set the `SYCL_DEVICE_TYPE` environment variable to `cpu` or `gpu` to select the device to use.


## Key Implementation Details

This sample illustrates several important oneMKL routines: matrix multiplication, rank-k updates, and triangular solves from BLAS (`gemm`, `syrk`, and `trsm`), and Cholesky factorization (`potrf`) from LAPACK.

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see the
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).


## Building the Block Cholesky Decomposition Sample
> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `$ bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - For Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or MacOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).


### Running Samples In Intel® DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Run `make` to build and run the factor and solve programs. You can remove all generated files with `make clean`.

### On a Windows* System
Run `nmake` to build and run the sample. `nmake clean` removes temporary files.

> **Warning**: On Windows, static linking with oneMKL currently takes a very long time due to a known compiler issue. This will be addressed in an upcoming release.
