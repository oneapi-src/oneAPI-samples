| Component | [getting_started](tutorial_getting_started.ipynb)  | The sample also includes a Jupyter notebook with step by step instructions on building code with different compilers and runtime configurations oneDNN support. |
| Component | [verbose_jitdump](tutorial_verbose_jitdump.ipynb) | This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use Verbose Mode and JIT Dump to profile oneDNN samples. |
| Component | [analyze_isa_with_dispatcher_control](tutorial_analyze_isa_with_dispatcher_control.ipynb) | This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use CPU Dispatch Control to generate JIT codes among different ISA on CPU and also analyze JIT kernels among ISAs.|
| Component | [Intel® vTune™ profiling](tutorial_vtune_profiling.ipynb) | This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to use VTune™ Profiler to profile oneDNN samples and find out performance bottlenecks. |
>  Notice : Please use Intel® oneAPI DevCloud as the environment for jupyter notebook samples. \
Users can refer to [DevCloud Getting Started](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/) for using DevCloud \
Users can use JupyterLab from DevCloud via "One-click Login in", and download samples via "git clone" or the "oneapi-cli" tool \
Once users are in the JupyterLab with downloaded jupyter notebook samples, they can start following the steps without further installation needed.
