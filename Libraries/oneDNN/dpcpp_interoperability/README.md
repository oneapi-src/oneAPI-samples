# `oneDNN DPC++ Interoperability`Sample

This C++ API example demonstrates programming for Intel&reg; Processor Graphics with SYCL extensions API in oneDNN.
Users will know how to access SYCL buffer and queue via oneDNN SYCL interoperability interfaces,
and this interface also helps users to execute a custom SYCL kernel with an oneDNN library.

## Purpose

This sample demonstrates programming for Intel(R) Processor Graphics with SYCL extensions API in oneDNN.

With this code sample, you will learn:
* How to create a GPU or CPU engine.
* How to create a memory descriptor/object.
* How to create a SYCL kernel for data initialization.
* How to access a SYCL buffer via SYCL interoperability interface.
* How to access a SYCL queue via SYCL interoperability interface.
* How to execute a SYCL kernel with related SYCL queue and SYCL buffer
* How to create operation descriptor/operation primitives descriptor/primitive.
* How to execute the primitive with the initialized memory.
* How to validate the result through a host accessor.

The sample executes on the system's CPU by default and can be executed on Intel GPU
using a command line parameter `gpu`.

## Key Implementation Details

This sample uses example file `${DNNLROOT}/examples/sycl_interop_buffer.cpp`
from oneDNN distribution. You can find this code in
[oneDNN Github repository](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/blob/dev-v2/examples/sycl_interop_buffer.cpp).

Detailed code walkthrough is available in [oneDNN developer guide](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/v2/sycl_interop_cpp.html)

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel速 oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel速 oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

## Building the sample for CPU and GPU

### On a Linux System

Perform the following steps:
1. Setup oneAPI development environment
```
source ${INTEL_ONEAPI_INSTALL_FOLDER}/setvars.sh
```
2. Build the program using `cmake`
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
>NOTE: The source file "sycl_interop_buffer.cpp" will be copied from ${INTEL_ONEAPI_INSTALL_FOLDER}/dnnl/latest/cpu_dpcpp_gpu_dpcpp/examples/ to build/src folder. Users can rebuild the sycl_interop_buffer.cpp by typing "make" under build folder.
3. Run the program
```
./bin/sycl-interop-buffer-cpp
```

### On a Windows* System

Open "Intel oneAPI command prompt for Intel 64 for Visual Studio 2017" or
"Intel oneAPI command prompt for Intel 64 for Visual Studio 2019" and perform the following steps:
1. Setup oneAPI development environment
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
```
2. Build the program using `cmake`
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\dnnl\latest\cpu_dpcpp_gpu_dpcpp\examples\
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ..
cmake --build .
```

3. Run the program
```
sycl-interop-buffer-cpp.exe
```

### Include Files

The include folder is located at ${DNNLROOT}\include on your development system".

## Running the Sample

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the [Intel速 oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### Application Parameters

You can specify the target device for this sample using command-line arguments:
* `cpu` (default) directs the application to run on the system's CPU
* `gpu` directs the sample to run on Intel GPU

> Note: When executed with `gpu` parameter the
> sample will return an error if there are no Intel GPUs are found in the system.

You can get additional information during the execution of this sample by setting
environment variable `DNNL_VERBOSE=1`.

#### On a Linux System
```
export DNNL_VERBOSE=1
```
#### On a Windows* System
```
set DNNL_VERBOSE=1
```

### Example of Output

```
Example passed on CPU.
```

When executed with `DNNL_VERBOSE=1`:
```
