  "description": "This sample illustrates how computational kernel can be split for execution between CPU and GPU using Intel® oneTBB Flow Graph asynchronous node and functional node. The Flow Graph asynchronous node uses SYCL to implement calculations on GPU while the functional node does CPU part of calculations. This TBB ASYNC SYCL sample code is implemented using C++ and SYCL language for Intel® CPU and GPU",
