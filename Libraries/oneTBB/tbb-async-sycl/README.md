# `TBB-Async-Sycl` Sample
This sample illustrates how the computational kernel can be split for execution between CPU and GPU using Intel速 oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) Flow Graph asynchronous node and functional node.

The Flow Graph asynchronous node uses SYCL* to implement GPU calculations while the functional node does the CPU part of calculations. This `tbb-async-sycl` sample code is implemented using C++ and SYCL* for CPU and GPU.

## Purpose
The purpose of this sample is to show how during execution, a computational kernel can be split between CPU and GPU using oneTBB Flow Graph asynchronous node and functional node.

## Key Implementation Details
Explains a oneTBB Flow Graph and SYCL*-compliant C++ implementation.

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)
You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel速 oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see the 
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel速 oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

## Building the `TBB-Async-Sycl` Program
> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `$ bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - For Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or MacOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux System
    * Build tbb-async-sycl program
      cd tbb-async-sycl &&
      mkdir build &&
      cd build &&
      cmake .. &&
      make VERBOSE=1

    * Run the program
      make run

    * Clean the program
      make clean

### On a Windows System

#### Command line using MSBuild
     * MSBuild tbb-async-sycl.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="debug"

#### Visual Studio IDE
     * Open Visual Studio 2017
     * Select Menu "File > Open > Project/Solution", find "tbb-async-sycl" folder and select "tbb-async-sycl.sln"
     * Select Menu "Project > Build" to build the selected configuration
     * Select Menu "Debug > Start Without Debugging" to run the program
