# `TBB-Async-Sycl` Sample
This sample illustrates how the computational kernel can be split for execution between CPU and GPU using TBB Flow Graph asynchronous node and functional node. The Flow Graph asynchronous node uses SYCL to implement GPU calculations while the functional node does the CPU part of calculations. This tbb-async-sycl sample code is implemented using C++ and SYCL language for CPU and GPU.

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.


## Building the TBB-Async-Sycl Program

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux System
    * Build tbb-async-sycl program
      cd tbb-async-sycl &&
      mkdir build &&
      cd build &&
      cmake .. &&
      make VERBOSE=1

    * Run the program
      make run

    * Clean the program
      make clean

### On a Windows System

#### Command line using MSBuild
     * MSBuild tbb-async-sycl.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="debug"

#### Visual Studio IDE
     * Open Visual Studio 2017
     * Select Menu "File > Open > Project/Solution", find "tbb-async-sycl" folder and select "tbb-async-sycl.sln"
     * Select Menu "Project > Build" to build the selected configuration
     * Select Menu "Debug > Start Without Debugging" to run the program
