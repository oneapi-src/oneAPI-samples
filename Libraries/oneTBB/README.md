# Code Samples of Intel(r) oneAPI Threading Building Blocks (oneAPI TBB)

| Code sample name                          | Supported Intel(r) Architecture(s) | Description
|:---                                       |:---                                |:---
| tbb-async-sycl             | GPU, CPU  | The calculations are split between TBB Flow Graph asynchronous node that calls SYCL kernel on GPU while TBB functional node does CPU part of calculations. 
| tbb-task-sycl              | GPU, CPU  | One TBB task executes SYCL code on GPU while another TBB task performs calculations using TBB parallel_for.
