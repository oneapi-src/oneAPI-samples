# `TBB-Task-Sycl` Sample
This sample illustrates how two TBB tasks can execute similar computational kernels, with one task executing the SYCL code and the other task executing the TBB code. This `tbb-task-sycl` sample code is implemented using C++ and SYCL language for CPU and GPU.
| Optimized for                     | Description
|:---                               |:---

| Hardware                          | Skylake with GEN9 or newer
| Software                          | Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler
| What you will learn               | How to offload the computation to GPU using Intel DPC++ compiler
| Time to complete                  | 15 minutes

## Purpose
The purpose of this sample is to show how similar computational kernels can be executed by two TBB tasks, with one executing on SYCL code and another on TBB code. 
  
## Key Implementation Details

## Building the TBB-Task-Sycl Program 

### On a Linux System 
    * Build tbb-task-sycl program 
      cd tbb-task-sycl &&
      mkdir build &&
      cd build &&
      cmake .. &&
      make VERBOSE=1

    * Run the program  
      make run

    * Clean the program  
      make clean

### On a Windows System

#### Command line using MSBuild
     * MSBuild tbb-task-sycl.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="debug"
   
#### Visual Studio IDE
     * Open Visual Studio 2017
     * Select Menu "File > Open > Project/Solution", find "tbb-task-sycl" folder and select "tbb-task-sycl.sln"
     * Select Menu "Project > Build" to build the selected configuration
     * Select Menu "Debug > Start Without Debugging" to run the program
