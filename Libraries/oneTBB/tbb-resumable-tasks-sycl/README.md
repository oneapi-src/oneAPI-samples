# `tbb-resumable-tasks-sycl` sample

This sample illustrates how computational kernel can be split for execution between CPU and GPU using TBB resumable task and parallel_for. The TBB resumable task uses SYCL to implement calculations on GPU while the parallel_for algorithm does CPU part of calculations. This tbb-resumable-tasks-sycl sample code is implemented using C++ and SYCL language for CPU and GPU.

## Purpose
The purpose of this sample is to show how during execution, a computational kernel can be split between CPU and GPU using TBB resumable tasks and TBB parallel_for.

## Key implementation details
TBB resumable tasks and DPC++ implementation explained.

## Building the tbb-resumable-tasks-sycl Program

### On a Linux System
    * Build tbb-resumable-tasks-sycl program
      cd tbb-resumable-tasks-sycl &&
      mkdir build &&
      cd build &&
      cmake .. && make VERBOSE=1

    * Run the program
      make run

    * Clean the program
      make clean

### On a Windows System

#### Command line using MSBuild
