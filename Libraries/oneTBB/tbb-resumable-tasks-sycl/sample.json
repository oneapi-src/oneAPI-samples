  "description": "This sample illustrates how computational kernel can be split for execution between CPU and GPU using TBB resumable task and parallel_for. The TBB resumable task uses SYCL to implement calculations on GPU while the parallel_for algorithm does CPU part of calculations. This tbb-resumable-tasks-sycl sample code is implemented using C++ and SYCL language for CPU and GPU.",
