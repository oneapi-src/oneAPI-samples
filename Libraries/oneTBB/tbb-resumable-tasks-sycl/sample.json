  "description": "This sample illustrates how computational kernel can be split for execution between CPU and GPU using Intel® oneTBB Resumable Task and parallel_for. The Intel® oneTBB resumable task uses SYCL to implement calculations on GPU while the parallel_for algorithm does CPU part of calculations. This TBB Resumable Tasks SYCL sample code is implemented using C++ and SYCL language for Intel® CPU and GPU",
