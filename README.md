# oneAPI Samples

The oneAPI-samples repository contains samples for the [Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html).

The latest versions of code samples on the master branch are not guaranteed to be stable. Use a [stable release version](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tags) of the repository.

## Get the oneAPI Samples

The version of the repository you use should match the version of the Intel® oneAPI Toolkit you have installed, particularly for the compilers.

Clone a stable version of the repository using Git by entering a command similar to the following:

`git clone -b <tag> https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git`

where \<tag\> is stable version number, like **2022.3.0**.

Alternatively, you can download a zip file containing a stable version of the repository. 

1. Select the appropriate tag.
2. Click the **Code** button.
3. Select **Download ZIP** from the menu options.
4. After downloading the file, unzip the repository contents.

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Windows

- If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, you must use Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 version 16.4.0 or newer.
- Windows support for the FPGA code samples is limited to the **FPGA emulator** and **optimization reports**. Only Linux supports **FPGA hardware** compilation. See any FPGA code sample README.md for more details.
- If you encounter `Error MSB6003 The specified task executable ... could not be run...` when building a sample program, it might be due to the length of the directory path. Move the sample to a temp directory with a shorter path and recompile.
