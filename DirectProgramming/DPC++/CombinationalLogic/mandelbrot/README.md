# `Mandelbrot` Sample

Mandelbrot is an infinitely complex fractal patterning that is derived from a simple formula.  It demonstrates using DPC++ for offloading computations to a GPU (or other devices) and shows how processing time can be optimized and improved with parallelism.

## Purpose
Mandelbrot is a DPC++ application that generates a fractal image by initializing a matrix of 512 x 512, where the computation at each point (pixel) is entirely independent of the computation at other points. The sample includes both parallel and serial calculation of the set, allowing for a direct comparison of results. The parallel implementation can demonstrate the use of Unified Shared Memory (USM) or buffers. You can modify parameters such as the number of rows, columns, and iterations to evaluate the difference in performance and load between USM and buffers. This is further described at the end of this document in the "Running the Sample" section.

The code will attempt first to execute on an available GPU and fallback to the system's CPU if a compatible GPU is not detected.  The device used for compilation is displayed in the output along with elapsed time to render the mandelbrot image. This is helpful for comparing different offload implementations based on complexity of the computation. 

## Key Implementation Details 
The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes device selector, buffer, accessor, kernel, and command groups.

## Building the `Mandelbrot` Program for CPU and GPU

### Include Files
The include folder is located at %ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include on your development system.

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Perform the following steps:
1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands. 
``` 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

> Note: by default, exectables are created for both USM and buffers. You can build individually with the following: 
>    Create buffers executable: make mandelbrot
>    Create USM executable: make mandelbrot_usm

2. Run the program (default uses buffers):
    ```
    make run
    ```
> Note: for USM use `make run_usm`

3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
* Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
      Right click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
      Right click on the project in Solution explorer and select Rebuild.
      From top menu select Debug -> Start without Debugging.


* Build the program using MSBuild
      Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017" or "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019"
      Run - MSBuild mandelbrot.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"


## Running the Sample
### Application Parameters 
You can modify the Mandelbrot parameters from within mandel.hpp. The configurable parameters include:
    row_size = 
    col_size =
    max_iterations =
    repetitions =
The default row and column size is 512.  Max interatins and repetions are both 100.  By adjusting the parameters, you can observe how the performance varies using the different offload techniques.  Note that if the values drop below 128 for row and column, the output is limted to just text in the ouput window.

### Example of Output
```
Platform Name: Intel(R) OpenCL HD Graphics
  Platform Version: OpenCL 2.1 
       Device Name: Intel(R) Gen9 HD Graphics NEO
    Max Work Group: 256
 Max Compute Units: 24
