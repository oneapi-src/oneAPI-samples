# `Prefix Sum` Sample

This code sample demonstrates how to implement parallel prefix sum SYCL*-compliant code to
offload the computation to a GPU. In this implementation, a random sequence of 2**n elements is given (n is a positive number) as input. The algorithm computes the prefix sum in parallel. The result sequence is in ascending order.

For comprehensive instructions, see the [Intel&reg; oneAPI Programming Guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi-programming-guide) and search based on relevant terms noted in the comments.

## Purpose

Given a randomized sequence of numbers x0, x1, x2, ..., xn, this algorithm computes and returns
a new sequence y0, y1, y2, ..., yn so that:

$y0 = x0$ <br>
$y1 = x0 + x1$ <br>
$y2 = x0 + x1 + x2$ <br>
..... <br>
$yn = x0 + x1 + x2 + ... + xn$

Below is the pseudo code for computing prefix sum in parallel:

n is power of 2 (1, 2, 4 , 8, 16, ...):
```
for i from 0 to  [log2 n] - 1 do
   for j from 0 to (n-1) do in parallel
     if j<2^i then
       x_{j}^{i+1} <- x_{j}^{i}}
     else
       x_{j}^{i+1} <- x_{j}^{i} + x_{j-2^{i}}^{i}}

```

In the above, the notation $x_{j}^{i}$ means the value of the jth element of array x in timestep i. Given n processors to perform each iteration of the inner loop in constant time, the algorithm
as a whole runs in $O(log n)$ time, the number of iterations of the outer loop.

The code attempts to execute on an available GPU and the code will fallback to the system CPU if a
compatible GPU is not detected.

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in Intel&reg; DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel&reg; DevCloud, you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit [Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/).


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On a Linux* System
1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands.
    ```
    $ cd PrefixSum
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    ```
2. Run the program.
    ```
    make run
    ```
3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```
If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```

#### Troubleshooting
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the Diagnostics Utility for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors. See [Diagnostics Utility for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html).

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
- Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
    - Right-click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
    - Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Rebuild.
    - From the top menu, select Debug -> Start without Debugging.

- Build the program using MSBuild
     - Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017" or "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019"
     - Run the following command: `MSBuild PrefixSum.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"`

## Running the sample
### Application Parameters

Usage: `PrefixSum <exponent> <seed>`

Where:
- `<exponent>` is a positive number. (The according length of the sequence is
2**exponent.)
- `<seed>` is the seed used by the random generator to generate the randomness.

The sample offloads the computation to GPU and then performs the verification
of the results in the CPU. The results are verified if $yk = yk-1 + xk$ the
original compared. If the results are matched, and the ascending order is
verified, the application will display a “Success!” message.

### Example of Output
```
$ ./PrefixSum 21 47

Sequence size: 2097152, seed: 47
Num iteration: 21
Device: Intel(R) Gen9 HD Graphics NEO
Kernel time: 170 ms

Success!
```
