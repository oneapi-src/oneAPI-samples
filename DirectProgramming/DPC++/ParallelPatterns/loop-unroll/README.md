# `Unrolling Loops` Sample
The Loop Unroll demonstrates a simple example of unrolling loops to improve the throughput of a DPC++ program for GPU offload.

For comprehensive instructions see the [DPC++ Programming](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi-programming-guide) and search based on relevant terms noted in the comments.

## Purpose

The loop unrolling mechanism is used to increase program parallelism by duplicating the compute logic within a loop. The number of times the loop logic is duplicated is called the *unroll factor*. Depending on whether the *unroll factor* is equal to the number of loop iterations or not, loop unroll methods can be categorized as *full-loop unrolling* and *partial-loop unrolling*. A full unroll is a special case where the unroll factor is equal to the number of loop iterations.


## Key Concepts
* Basics of loop unrolling.
* How to unroll loops in your program.
* Determining the optimal unroll factor for your program.

## Building the `loop_unroll` Tutorial

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (fpga_compile or fpga_runtime) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)).


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

## Building the `loop-unroll` Program for CPU and GPU

### Running Samples In DevCloud

If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must
specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in
batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI
Base Toolkit Get Started Guide
(https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
  1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands.

  ```
  $ cd loop-unroll
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
  ```

  2. Run the program

  ```
  $ make run
  ```

  3. Clean the program

  ```
  $ make clean
  ```

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.
[Learn more](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html).

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
- Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
    - Right-click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
    - Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Rebuild.
    - From the top menu, select Debug -> Start without Debugging.

- Build the program using MSBuild
     - Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017" or "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019"
     - Run the following command: `MSBuild loop-unroll.sln.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"`
