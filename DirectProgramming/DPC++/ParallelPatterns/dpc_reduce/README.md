# dpc_reduce Sample

The dpc_reduce is a simple program that calculates pi.  This program is implemented using C++ and Data Parallel C++ (DPC++) for Intel(R) CPU and accelerators. This code sample also demonstrates how to incorporate Data Parallel PC++ into
a MPI program.

## Purpose
This example demonstrates how to do reduction by using the CPU in serial mode, 
the CPU in parallel mode (using TBB), the GPU using direct DPC++ coding, the 
GPU using multiple steps with DPC++ Library algorithms transform and reduce, 
and then finally using the DPC++ Library transform_reduce algorithm.  

All the different modes use a simple calculation for Pi.   It is a well known 
mathematical formula that if you integrate from 0 to 1 over the function, 
(4.0 / (1+x*x) )dx the answer is pi.   One can approximate this integral 
by summing up the area of a large number of rectangles over this same range.  

Each of the different function calculates pi by breaking the range into many 
tiny rectangles and then summing up the results. 

The parallel computations are performed using oneTBB and oneAPI DPC++ library 
(oneDPL).

This example also demonstrates how to incorporate Data Parallel PC++ into a MPI program.
Using Data Parallel C++, the code sample runs multiple MPI ranks to distribute the
calculation of the number Pi. Each rank offloads the computation to an accelerator
(GPU/CPU) using Intel DPC++ compiler to compute a partial compution of the number Pi.

If you run the sample on a CPU as your default device,  you may need to increase 
the memory allocation for openCL.  You can do this by setting an environment variable, 
    "CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE=16MB


## Key Implementation Details
The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes accessor,
kernels, queues, buffers as well as some oneDPL library calls.

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system".

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Perform the following steps:
1. Build the program using the following 'cmake' commands
export I_MPI_CXX=dpcpp 
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake .. 
make 

2. Run the program using:
make run or './dpc_reduce' or 'mpirun ./dpc_reduce'

3. Clean the program using:
make clean
