| What you will learn   | how to perform reduction with oneAPI on cpu and gpu
| Time to complete      | 30 min 

## Purpose
This example demonstrates how to do reduction by using the CPU in serial mode, 
the CPU in parallel mode (using TBB), the GPU using direct DPC++ coding, the 
GPU using multiple steps with DPC++ Library algorithms transform and reduce, 
and then finally using the DPC++ Library transform_reduce algorithm.  

All the different modes use a simple calculation for Pi.   It is a well known 
mathematical formula that if you integrate from 0 to 1 over the function, 
(4.0 / (1+x*x) )dx the answer is pi.   One can approximate this integral 
by summing up the area of a large number of rectangles over this same range.  

Each of the different function calculates pi by breaking the range into many 
tiny rectangles and then summing up the results. 

The parallel computations are performed using oneTBB and oneAPI DPC++ library 
(oneDPL).

## Key Implementation Details
The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes accessor,
kernels, queues, buffers as well as some oneDPL library calls.

## Building the dpc_reduce program for CPU and GPU

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system".

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Perform the following steps:
1. Build the program using the following 'cmake' commands 
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake .. 
make 

2. Run the program using:
make run or src/dpc_reduce 

3. Clean the program using:
make clean
