# DPC++ OpenCL&trade; Interoperability Example

This examples demonstrate how DPC++ can interact with OpenCL&trade;. This code shample will show  programmers to incrementally migrate from
OpenCL to DPC++. Two usage scenarios are shown. First is a DPC++ program that compiles and runs an OpenCL kernel. The second program converts OpenCL objects to DPC++.

For more information on migrating from OpenCL to DPC++, see [Migrating OpenCL Designs to DPC++](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/migrating-opencl-designs-to-dpcpp.html).

## Purpose
For users migrating from OpenCL to DPC++, interoperability allows the migration to take place piecemeal so that the migration of all kernels does not have to occur simultaneously.
 
## Key Implementation Details
The common OpenCL to DPC++ conversion scenarios are covered.
1. In dpcpp_with_opencl_kernel.dp.cpp, the DPC++ program compiles and runs an OpenCL kernel. (For this, OpenCL must be set as the backend and not Level 0, the environment variable SYCL_DEVICE_FILTER=OPENCL is used)
2. In dpcpp_with_opencl_objects.dp.cpp, the program converts OpenCL objects (Memory Objects, Platform, Context, Program, Kernel) to DPC++ and execute the program.

## Building the Program

> Note: if you have not already done so, set up your CLI 
> environment by sourcing  the setvars script located in 
> the root of your oneAPI installation. 
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh  
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh  
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/baseToolkitSamples/)

### On a Linux* System
Perform the following steps:
1. Build the program
	```
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
	$ make
	```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    make run_prog1
    make run_prog2
    ```

3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

### Example of Output
