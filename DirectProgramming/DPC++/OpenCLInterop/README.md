# OpenCL&trade; Interoperability Example

This examples demonstrate how OpenCL&trade; can interact with SYCL* standards. This code
sample illustrates how to incrementally migrate from OpenCL to SYCL* compliant code in two usage scenarios: 
1. A program that compiles and runs
an OpenCL kernel using SYCL*.
2. A program that converts OpenCL objects using SYCL standards. (For more information, read this [article](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/migrating-opencl-designs-to-dpcpp.html).)


| Property            | Description 
|:---                 |:---
| What you will learn | How to OpenCL code can interact with SYCL* using the Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler
| Time to complete    | 10 minutes


## Purpose

For users migrating from OpenCL to SYCL*, the sample demonstrates interoperability that enables incremental migration. simultaneous migration of existing OpenCL kernels is not necessary.

## Prerequisites

| Optimized for        | Description
|:---                  |:---
| OS                   | Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04, 20
| Hardware             | Skylake or newer
| Software             | Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler


## Key Implementation Details

Common OpenCL to SYCL* conversion scenario is demonstrated.

1. In `dpcpp_with_opencl_objects.dp.cpp`, the program converts OpenCL objects
   (Memory Objects, Platform, Context, Program, Kernel) to conform with SYCL* standards and executes the program.

## Building the Program

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
>
> Windows:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Running Samples in Intel&reg; DevCloud

If running a sample in the Intel&reg; DevCloud, you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit [Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/).


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with IntelÂ® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On Linux*

Perform the following steps:

1. Build the program
	```
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
	$ make
	```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    make run_prog1
    make run_prog2
    ```

3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```

#### Troubleshooting
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the Diagnostics Utility for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors. See [Diagnostics Utility for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html).
