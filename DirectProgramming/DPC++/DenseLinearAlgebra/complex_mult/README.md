# Complex Multiplication sample

complex multiplication is a program that multiplies two large vectors of 
Complex numbers in parallel and verifies the results. It also implements 
custom device selector to target a specific vendor device. This program is 
implemented using C++ and DPC++ language for Intel CPU and accelerators. 
The Complex class is a custom class and this program shows how we can use 
custom types of classes in a DPC++ program

## Purpose	

Complex multiplication multiplies two vectors with complex numbers. The 
code will attempt to run the calculation on both the GPU and CPU, and then 
verifies the results. The size of the computation can be adjusted for 
heavier workloads. If successful, the name of the offload device and a 
success message are displayed.

This sample uses buffers to manage memory. For more information regarding
different memory management options, refer to the vector_add sample.

complex multiplication includes C++ implementations of both Data Parallel 
(DPC++). 

This program shows how to create a custom device selector and to target 
GPU or CPU of a specific vendor. The program also shows how to pass in a 
vector of custom Complex class objects that you can do the parallel 
executions on the device. The device used for compilation is displayed in 
the output.


## Key implementation details 

This program shows how we can use custom types of classes in a DPC++ 
program and explains the basic DPC++ implementation including device 
selector, buffer, accessor, kernel and command group.

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify 
the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or 
interactive mode. For more information see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit 
Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)
