    "So far we have used a work-group size of 16, and while that is not the only valid size, it is often a good place to start for portability across Intel® devices.  In our previous implementation we used the below code to determine our device and query the maximum work-group size.  It was used to identify the platform to make sure we were executing on the right accelerator.  Querying the maximum work-group size was informational.  \n",

    "Below is the output that resulted, in the run scripts we pass the matrix size and the work-group size manually.  One can specify each with -m and -n switches which will use those values instead.  Not ideal if running across multiple platforms with multiple types of accelerators.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In the case of an Intel® Iris® Xe MAX GPU, 512 is the max_work_group_size. The square root of 512 is 22.6. Using 22 would provide an invalid work-group size, since it does not divide the matrix size of 5120 equally. We need to figure out what the maximum work-group size is that we can have that also divides the matrix size equally. The valid work-group sizes would be: 20x20, 16x16, 10x10, 8x8, and so on. Maximum does not always mean best result; we have to try different work-group sizes to determine the best result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of CPUs, 8192 is the max_work_group_size. The valid work-group sizes would be: 80x80, 64x64, 40x40, 32x32, 20x20, 16x16, and so on.\n"
