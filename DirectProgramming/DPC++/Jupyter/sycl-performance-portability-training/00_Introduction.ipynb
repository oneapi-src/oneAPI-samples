    "Developers of high performance computing applications are faced with an increasingly diverse number of computing platforms featuring multiple generations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs. Developing code that is performant and portable across a diverse set of platforms is expensive in terms of time spent trying to achieve the best result across a given set of platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "This learning path will explore the use of oneAPI and Data Parallel C++ to demonstrate a method to achieve performant, portable code across five different platforms available on the Intel Devcloud. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will define Performance, Portability and Productivity as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Performance__: Measurable quantity representing a characteristic of an application run on a platform. Typically, throughput or time-to-solution. We often express it as percentage of peak performance on platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Portability__: Ability of application to run the correctly on different platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Productivity__: The ratio of application code output to invested development effort, where application code output represents features, optimizations, maintenance, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The achievement of performance, portability, and productivity builds on these three requirements: \"An application is performance portable if it achieves a consistent ratio of the actual time-to-solution to either the best-known or the theoretical best time-to-solution on each platform with minimal platform-specific code required.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to demonstrate this, we explore several general matrix multiply (GEMM) algorithm examples using SYCL programming language, introduce several techniques to measure the effectiveness of the applications across the platforms, use timer functions inside the applications measuring kernel and compute times, and use this information to compute relative efficiency to a best implementation. In addition, we use roofline analysis and VTune™ analyzer to measure the application’s performance across the represented platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our learning path will not be an exhaustive optimization exercise nor considered benchmarking; rather, we focus on using SYCL as a method for heterogeneous programming that enables the developer to execute their code across CPUs and GPUs with minimal changes to the source. We also explore some techniques to improve the performance of the GEMM examples across platforms and introduce tools to gain insight into an application.\n"

SYCL is a __single source__ language where host code and __heterogeneous accelerator kernels__ can be mixed in same source files. A SYCL program is invoked on the host computer and offloads the computation to an accelerator. Programmers use familiar C++ and library constructs with added functionalities like a __queue__ for work targeting, __buffer__ for data management, and __parallel_for__ for parallelism to direct which parts of the computation and data should be offloaded."

    "Requirements for a roofline model on a GPU\n",
    "To generate a roofline analysis report, an application must be at least partially running on a GPU, Gen9, or Gen11 integrated graphics card, and the offload must be implemented with OpenMP*, SYCL*, DPC++, or OpenCL™ software and a recent version of Intel Advisor.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### FPU Utilization\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric represents how intensively your program uses the FPU. 100 percent means that the FPU is fully loaded and is retiring a vector instruction with full capacity every cycle of the application execution.\n",
    "Possible Issues: The metric value is low. This can indicate poor FPU utilization because of non-vectorized floating point operations, or inefficient vectorization due to legacy vector instruction set or memory access pattern issues. Consider using vector analysis in Intel Advisor for data and tips to improve vectorization efficiency in your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Occupancy\n",
    "\n",
    "The normalized sum of all cycles on all core and thread slots when a slot has a thread scheduled. Possible Issues: Low value of the occupancy metric may be caused by inefficient work scheduling. Make sure work items are neither too small nor too large.\n",
    "\n",
