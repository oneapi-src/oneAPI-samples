    "Our previous implementation of a naive parallel kernel did not allow for performance optimizations at a hardware level. In these next two kernels we will utilize ND-Range kernels as a way to expresses parallelism enabling low level performance tuning by providing access to both global and local memory and mapping executions to compute units on hardware. The entire iteration space is divided into smaller groups called work-groups, work-items are organized into these work-groups and are scheduled on a single compute unit on the hardware.  Workgroup size must divide the entire ND-range size exactly in each dimension.  These sizes can all vary by hardware platform and by using the device queries below a developer can identify what is possible.  The workload must be considered to find the best mix of these values.\n",

The work-group size depends on the accelerator hardware capability, so we set this size using command-line argument. Some hardware require the matrix size to divide equally by the work-group size, we will use work-group size of 16x16 (256) by default which works for all the accelerator hardware we will be using to test, we will eventually use different work-group sizes to see how it impacts the performance.\n",
