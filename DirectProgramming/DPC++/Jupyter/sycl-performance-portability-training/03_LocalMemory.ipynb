    "\n",
    "In a matrix multiplication algorithm, there is a high degree of reuse, so instead of loading values from global memory each time we can load the values into local memory and perform the computation.  This will reduce the latency of accessing the data values.  The difference between this implementation and the ND-range implementation is the reading is done from global memory in the case of ND-range each time and in this implementation both matrix A and B are loaded into local memory and then computed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a work-group begins, the contents of its local memory are uninitialized, and local memory does not persist after a work-group finishes executing. Because of these properties, local memory may only be used for temporary storage while a work-group is executing.  For other devices though, such as many GPU devices, there are dedicated resources for local memory, and on these devices, communicating via local memory should perform better than communicating via global memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare local memory for use in an ND-range kernel, use a local accessor. Like other accessor objects, a local accessor is constructed within a command group handler, but unlike the accessor objects, a local accessor is not created from a buffer object.  From the following example, A_tile and B_tile are the local accessors we have defined that load the 16x16 items.  These are used to compute an intermediate result which does not use global memory for repeated access for computation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify kernel development and accelerate communication between work-items in a work-group, SYCL defines a special local memory space specifically for communication between work-items in a work-group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also notice that we used a barrier that helps to synchronize all of the work-items in the work-group.  The performance is much better than the initial ND-range samples and slightly better than the ND-range sample utilizing local memory.\n",
