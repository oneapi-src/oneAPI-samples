    "One of the best ways to achieve performance portable code is to take advantage of a library.  In this case oneMKL offers a compelling GEMM implementation that we will use as our baseline.  If there is a library, it should always be ones first attempt at achieving performant portable code.  All other implementations will be measured against oneMKL.  \n",

The library has C and Fortran interfaces for most routines on CPU, and SYCL interfaces for some routines on both CPU and GPU. You can find comprehensive support for several math operations in various interfaces including:\n",
