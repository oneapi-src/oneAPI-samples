# ISO3DFD sample
ISO3DFD is a finite difference stencil kernel for solving 3D acoustic isotropic wave equation which can be used as a proxy for propogating a seismic wave. Kernels in this sample are implemented as 16th order in space, with symmetric coefficients, and 2nd order in time scheme without boundary conditions. This sample code is implemented using Data Parallel C++ for CPU and GPU and using OpenMP on CPU for comparison and validation.

### on Windows

INSTRUCTIONS HERE. EXAMPLE:

## How to Run  
   * Application Parameters   
	Usage: ./iso3dfd n1 n2 n3 b1 b2 b3 Iterations [omp|sycl] [gpu|cpu]
	
	n1 n2 n3      : Grid sizes for the stencil
	b1 b2 b3      : cache block sizes for cpu openmp version.
	Iterations    : No. of timesteps.
	[omp|sycl]    : Optional: Run the OpenMP or the SYCL variant. Default is to use both for validation
	[gpu|cpu]     : Optional: Device to run the SYCL version Default is to use the GPU if available, if not fallback to CPU


## Performance Tests
