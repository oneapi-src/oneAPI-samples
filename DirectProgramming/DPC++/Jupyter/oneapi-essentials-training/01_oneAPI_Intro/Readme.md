The simple-vector-incr and simple-vector-add programs are simpler implementations of vector-add.  The learning objective for a developer inspecting simple-vector-incr.cpp is to follow the instructions in the comments within the code. Following Steps 1 - 5 the developer will modify the code from that of adding element-wise +1 to an input vector and eventually adding in pieces another input vector, buffer, and accessor that adds two vectors together.  The final product should look similar to simple-vector-add.cpp.

| What you will learn               | The developer will learn about buffers, accessors, and command group handlers.
| Time to complete                  | 15 minutes  
  
## Key implementation details 
The implementation of the simple-vector-incr program is such that a developer following Steps 1 - 5 embedded in the code will learn abou the buffers, accessors, and command group handler.
