    "__DPC++ programs__ are standard C++. The program is invoked on the __host__ computer, and offloads computation to the __accelerator__. You will use DPC++’s __queue, buffer, device, and kernel abstractions__ to direct which parts of the computation and data should be offloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DPC++ compiler and the oneAPI libraries automate the tedious and error-prone aspects of compute and data offload, but still allow you to control how computation and data are distributed for best performance. The compiler knows how to generate code for both the host and the accelerator, how to launch computation on the accelerator, and how to move data back and forth. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the program below you will use a data parallel algorithm with DPC++ to leverage the computational power in __heterogenous computers__. The DPC++ platform model includes a host computer and a device. The host offloads computation to the device, which could be a __GPU, FPGA, or a multi-core CPU__.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step in a DPC++ program, create a __queue__. Offload computation to a __device__ by submitting tasks to a queue. You can choose CPU, GPU, FPGA, and other devices through the __selector__. This program uses the default q here, which means the DPC++ runtime selects the most capable device available at runtime by using the default selector. You will learn more about devices, device selectors, and the concepts of buffers, accessors and kernels in the upcoming modules, but here is a simple DPC++ program to get you started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Device and host can either share physical __memory__ or have distinct memories. When the memories are distinct, offloading computation requires __copying data between host and device__. DPC++ does not require you to manage the data copies. By creating __Buffers and Accessors__, DPC++ ensures that the data is available to host and device without any effort on your part. DPC++ also allows you explicit control over data movement to achieve best peformance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a DPC++ program, we define a __kernel__, which is applied to every point in an index space. For simple programs like this one, the index space maps directly to the elements of the array. The kernel is encapsulated in a __C++ lambda function__. The lambda function is passed a point in the index space as an array of coordinates. For this simple program, the index space coordinate is the same as the array index. The __parallel_for__ in the below program applies the lambda to the index space. The index space is defined in the first argument of the parallel_for as a 1 dimensional __range from 0 to N-1__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __parallel_for__ is nested inside another lamba function, which is passed as an argument in the below program where we __submit to the queue__. The DPC++ runtime invokes the lambda when the accelerator connected to the queue is ready. The handler argument to the lambda allows operations inside the lambda to define the __data and dependences__ with other computation that may be executed on host or devices. You will see more of this in later modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the program does a __q.wait()__ on the queue. The earlier submit operation queues up an operation to be performed at a later time and immmediately returns. If the host wants to see the result of the computation, it must wait for the work to complete with a wait. Sometimes the device will encounter an error. The q.wait_and_throw() is a way for the host to capture and handle the error that has happened on the device.\n",
