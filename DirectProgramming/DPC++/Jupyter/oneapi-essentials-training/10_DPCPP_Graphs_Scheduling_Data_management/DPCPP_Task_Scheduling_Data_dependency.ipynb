    "### Explicit Data Movement\n",
    "In a SYCL program one option for managing multiple memories is for the programmer to explicitly copy data between host and the device and once the computation is done it needs to be copied back to the host from the device. This can be done explicitly by the programmer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, once we offload computation to a device by submitting tasks to a queue and the kernel computes new results,\n",
    "the data needs to be copied back to the host program. One of the main advantages of explicit transfer is that the programmer has full control over when data is transferred between the device and the host and back to host from the device,  and this is important and can be essential to obtaining the best performance on some hardware.\n",
    " \n",
    "The disadvantage of explicit data movement is that transferring explicitly by the programmer can be tedious process and error prone. Transferring incorrect data or transferring the data back to host at incorrect time can lead to incorrect results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting all of the data movement correct up front can be a time-consuming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implicit data movement\n",
    "The alternative to explicit data movement is implicit data movement. This is controlled by the runtime or driver and here the runtime is responsible for ensuring that data is transferred to the appropriate memory before it is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of implicit data movement is that it requires less effort on the programmer’s\tpart and  all the heavy lifting is done by the runtime. This also reduces the opportunity to introduce errors into the program since the runtime will automatically identify both when data transfers must be performed and how much data must be transferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback of implicit data movement is that the programmer has less or no control over the behavior of the runtime’s implicit mechanisms. The runtime will provide functional correctness but may not move data in an optimal fashion that could have a negative impact on program performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting the right strategy: explicit or implicit\n",
    "A programmer might choose to begin using implicit data movement to simplify porting an application to a new device. As we \n",
    "begin tuning the application for performance, we might start replacing implicit data movement with explicit in performance-critical parts of the code.\n"
