    "__Buffers__ are high level abstarction for data and these are accessbile either on the host machine or on the devices. Buffers encapsulate data in a SYCL application across both devices and host. __Accessors__ is the mechanism to access buffer data. Buffers are 1, 2 or 3 dimensional data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspects of data parallel computations is how they access data to accelerate a computation.\n",
    "Accelerator devices often have their own attached memories that cannot be directly accessed from the host. Device and host can either share physical memory or have distinct memories. When the memories are distinct, offloading computation requires copying data between host and device. DPC++ does not require you to manage the data copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By __creating Buffers and Accessors, DPC++ ensures that the data is available to host and device without any effort on your part__. DPC++ also allows you explicit control over data movement to achieve best peformance. Buffers are accessible on the host and may be accessible on multiple devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "USM forces programmers to think about where memory lives and what should be accessible where. The buffer abstraction is a higher-level model that hides this from the programmer. Buffers simply represent data, and it becomes the job of the runtime to \n",
    "manage how the data is stored and moved in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "While buffers abstract how we represent and store data in a program,we do not directly access the data using the buffer. Instead, we use accessor objects that inform the runtime how we intend\tto use\n",

This ensures that the data that gets copied back to the host is the correct value of the computation the graph was performing. \n",

Creating host accessor is a __blocking call__ and execution on the host may not proceed past the creation of the host accessor until the data is available. Likewise, a buffer cannot be used on a device while a host accessor exists and keeps its data available, consider creating host accessors inside additional C++ scopes in order to free the data once the host accessor is no longer needed. This is an example of the next method for host synchronization.\n",
