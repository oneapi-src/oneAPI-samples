    "__oneAPI__ programs are written in __Data Parallel C++ (DPC++)__. It is based on modern C++ productivity benefits and familiar constructs and incorporates the __SYCL__ standard for data parallelism and heterogeneous programming. DPC++ is a __single source__ where __host code__ and __heterogeneous accelerator kernels__ can be mixed in same source files. A DPC++ program is invoked on the host computer and offloads the computation to an accelerator. Programmers use familiar C++ and library constructs with added functionliaties like a __queue__ for work targeting, __buffer__ for data management, and __parallel_for__ for parallelism to direct which parts of the computation and data should be offloaded."

    "\n",
    "As a first step in a DPC++ program we create a __queue__. We offload computation to a __device__ by submitting tasks to a queue. The programmer can choose CPU, GPU, FPGA, and other devices through the __selector__. This program uses the default  q here, which means DPC++ runtime selects the most capable device available at runtime by using the default selector. We will talk about the devices, device selectors, and the concepts of buffers, accessors and kernels in the upcoming modules but below is a simple DPC++ program for you to get started with the above concepts.\n",

DPC++ does not require the programmer to manage the data copies. By creating __Buffers and Accessors__, DPC++ ensures that the data is available to host and device without any programmer effort. DPC++ also allows the programmer explicit control over data movement when it is necessary to achieve best peformance.\n",

For this simple program, the index space coordinate is the same as the array index. The __parallel_for__ in the below program applies the lambda to the index space.
