# oneAPI training Jupyter notebooks 

The purpose of this repo is to be the central aggregation, curation, and distribution point for Juypter notebooks that are developed in support of oneAPI training programs (e.g. oneAPI Essentials Series). 

The Jupyter notebooks are tested and can be run on Intel Devcloud.
Below are the steps to access these Jupyter notebooks on Intel Devcloud
1. Register to Intel devcloud 
    https://intelsoftwaresites.secure.force.com/devcloud/oneapi
2. Go to the "Terminal" in the Intel Devcloud
3. Type in the below command to download the oneAPI-essentials series notebooks into your devcloud account
    /data/oneapi_workshop/get_jupyter_notebooks.sh
