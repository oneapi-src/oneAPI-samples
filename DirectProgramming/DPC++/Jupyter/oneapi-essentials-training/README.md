# oneAPI training Jupyter notebooks

The purpose of this repo is to be the central aggregation, curation, and
distribution point for Juypter notebooks that are developed in support of
oneAPI training programs (e.g., oneAPI Essentials Series).

The Jupyter notebooks are tested and can be run on the Intel Devcloud. Below
are the steps to access these Jupyter notebooks on the Intel Devcloud:

1. Register with the Intel Devcloud at
   https://intelsoftwaresites.secure.force.com/devcloud/oneapi

2. SSH into the Intel Devcloud "terminal"

3. Type the following command to download the oneAPI-essentials series of
   Jupyter notebooks and OpenMP offload notebooks into your devcloud account
   `/data/oneapi_workshop/get_jupyter_notebooks.sh`
