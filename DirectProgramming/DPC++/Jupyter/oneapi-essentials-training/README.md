# oneAPI training Jupyter notebooks
The purpose of this repo is to be the central aggregation, curation, and distribution point for Juypter notebooks that are developed in support of oneAPI training programs (e.g. oneAPI Essentials Series).  These are the hands-on components to be used in conjunction with training slides.

# The organization of the Jupyter notebook directories is a follows:
