 # `All Pairs Shortest Paths` Sample
`All Pairs Shortest Paths` uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between pairs of vertices in a graph. It uses a parallel blocked algorithm that enables the application to offload compute intensive work to the GPU efficiently.

## Purpose
This sample uses blocked Floyd-Warshall all pairs shortest paths algorithm to compute a matrix representing the minimum distance from any node to all other nodes in the graph. Using parallel blocked processing, blocks can be calculated simultaneously by distributing task computations to the GPU. For comparison, the application is run sequentially and parallelly with run times for each displayed in the application's output. The device where the code is run is also identified.

The parallel implementation of the blocked Floyd-Warshall algorithm has three phases. Given that a prior round of these computation phases is complete, phase 1 is independent; Phase 2 can only execute after phase 1 completes; Similarly, phase 3 depends on phase 2 to only execute after phase 2 is complete.

The inner loop of the sequential implementation is:
  g[i][j] = min(g[i][j], g[i][k] + g[k][j])

A careful observation shows that for the kth iteration of the outer loop, the computation depends on cells either on the kth column, g[i][k] or on the kth row, g[k][j] of the graph. Phase 1 handles g[k][k], phase 2 handles g[\*][k] and g[k][\*], and phase 3 handles g[\*][\*] in that sequence. These cell level observations largely propagate to the blocks as well. 

In each phase, computation within a block can proceed independently in parallel.
