 # `All Pairs Shortest Paths` Sample

`All Pairs Shortest Paths` uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the
shortest paths between pairs of vertices in a graph. It uses a parallel blocked
algorithm that enables the application to offload compute intensive work to the
GPU efficiently.

For comprehensive instructions see the [DPC++ Programming](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi-programming-guide) and search based on relevant terms noted in the comments.

## Purpose

This sample uses blocked Floyd-Warshall all pairs shortest paths algorithm to
compute a matrix representing the minimum distance from any node to all other
nodes in the graph. Using parallel blocked processing, blocks can be calculated
simultaneously by distributing task computations to the GPU. For comparison,
the application is run sequentially and parallelly with run times for each
displayed in the application's output. The device where the code is run is also
identified.

The parallel implementation of the blocked Floyd-Warshall algorithm has three
phases. Given that a prior round of these computation phases is complete, phase
1 is independent; Phase 2 can only execute after phase 1 completes; Similarly,
phase 3 depends on phase 2 to only execute after phase 2 is complete.

The inner loop of the sequential implementation is:
  g[i][j] = min(g[i][j], g[i][k] + g[k][j])

A careful observation shows that for the kth iteration of the outer loop, the
computation depends on cells either on the kth column, g[i][k] or on the kth
row, g[k][j] of the graph. Phase 1 handles g[k][k], phase 2 handles g[\*][k]
and g[k][\*], and phase 3 handles g[\*][\*] in that sequence. These cell level
observations largely propagate to the blocks as well.

In each phase, computation within a block can proceed independently in parallel.

## Setting Environment Variables


For working at a Command-Line Interface (CLI), the tools in the oneAPI toolkits
are configured using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by
sourcing the ``setvars`` script every time you open a new terminal window. This
will ensure that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.


### Linux
Source the script from the installation location, which is typically in one of
these folders:


For root or sudo installations:


  ``. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh``


For normal user installations:

  ``. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh``

**Note:** If you are using a non-POSIX shell, such as csh, use the following command:

     ``$ bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'``

If environment variables are set correctly, you will see a confirmation
message.

If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the
Diagnostics Utility for Intel速 oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system
checks to find missing dependencies and permissions errors.
[Learn more](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html).


**Note:** [Modulefiles scripts](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-modulefiles-with-linux.html)
    can also be used to set up your development environment.
    The modulefiles scripts work with all Linux shells.


**Note:** If you wish to fine
    tune the list of components and the version of those components, use
    a [setvars config file](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos/use-a-config-file-for-setvars-sh-on-linux-or-macos.html)
    to set up your development environment.

### Windows

Execute the  ``setvars.bat``  script from the root folder of your
oneAPI installation, which is typically:


  ``"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat"``


For Windows PowerShell* users, execute this command:

  ``cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'``


If environment variables are set correctly, you will see a confirmation
message.

If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the
Diagnostics Utility for Intel速 oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system
checks to find missing dependencies and permissions errors.

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the [Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel速 oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On a Linux* System

Perform the following steps:

1.  Build the program using the following <code> cmake </code> commands.
```
    $ cd all-pairs-shortest-paths
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
```

2.  Run the program <br>
```
    $ make run

```

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``

Intel速 oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
- Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
    - Right-click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
