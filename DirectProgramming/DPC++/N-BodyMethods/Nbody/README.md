# `Nbody` sample
An N-body simulation is a simulation of a dynamical system of particles, usually under the influence of physical forces, such as gravity. This nbody sample code is implemented using C++ and DPC++ language for Intel CPU and GPU.

## Purpose
Nbody sample code simulates 16000 particles and for ten integration steps. Each particle's position, velocity and acceleration parameters are dependent on other (N-1) particles. This algorithm is highly data parallel and a perfect candidate to offload to GPU. The code demonstrates how to deal with multiple device kernels, which can be enqueued into a DPC++ queue for execution and how to handle parallel reductions.

## Key Implementation Details 
The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes device selector, buffer, accessor, kernel, and command groups.

## Building the Program for CPU and GPU

### Include Files  
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### On a Linux* System
Perform the following steps:
1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands. 
``` 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
2. Run the program 
    ```
    make run
    ```

3. Clean the program 
    ```
    make clean
    ```

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
- Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
    - Right-click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
    - Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Rebuild.
    - From the top menu, select Debug -> Start without Debugging.

- Build the program using MSBuild
     - Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017" or "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019"
     - Run the following command: `MSBuild Hello_World_GPU.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"`
     
### Application Parameters 
You can modify the NBody simulation parameters from within GSimulation.cpp. The configurable parameters include:
- set_npart(__);
- set_nsteps(__);
- set_tstep(__);
- set_sfreq(__);

Below are the default parameters:

* Number of particles (npart) is 16000
* Number of integration steps (nsteps) is 10
* Time delta (tstep) is 0.1s
* Sample frequency (sfreq) is 1
