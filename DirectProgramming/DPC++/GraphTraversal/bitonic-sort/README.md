# `Bitonic Sort` Sample

This code sample demonstrates the implementation of bitonic sort using Intel Data Parallel C++ to
offload the computation to a GPU. In this implementation, a random sequence of 2**n elements is given
(n is a positive number) as input, and the algorithm sorts the sequence in parallel. The result sequence is
in ascending order.

## Purpose

The algorithm converts a randomized sequence of numbers into
a bitonic sequence (two ordered sequences) and then merges these two ordered
sequences into an ordered sequence. Bitonic sort algorithm is briefly
described as followed:

- First, it decomposes the randomized sequence of size 2\*\*n into 2\*\*(n-1)
pairs where each pair consists of 2 consecutive elements. Note that each pair
is a bitonic sequence.
- Step 0: for each pair (sequence of size 2), the two elements are swapped so
that the two consecutive pairs form  a bitonic sequence in increasing order,
the next two pairs form the second bitonic sequence in decreasing order.
The next two pairs form the third bitonic sequence in increasing order, etc., ....
At the end of this step, we have 2\*\*(n-1) bitonic sequences of size 2, and
they follow an order of increasing, decreasing, increasing, .., decreasing.
Thus, they form 2\*\*(n-2) bitonic sequences of size 4.
- Step 1: for each new 2\*\*(n-2) bitonic sequences of size 4, (each new
sequence consists of 2 consecutive previous sequences), it swaps the elements
so that at the end of step 1, we have 2\*\*(n-2) bitonic sequences of size 4,
and they follow an order: increasing, decreasing, increasing, ...,
decreasing. Thus, they form 2\*\*(n-3) bitonic sequences of size 8.
- Same logic applies until we reach the last step.
- Step n: at this last step, we have one bitonic sequence of size 2\*\*n. The
elements in the sequence are swapped until we have a sequence in increasing
order.

The code will attempt first to execute on an available GPU and fallback to the system's CPU
if a compatible GPU is not detected.

## Key Implementation Details

The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes device selector, buffer, accessor, kernel, and command g
roups. Unified Shared Memory (USM) and Buffer Object are used for data management.

### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to
this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.


## Setting Environment Variables


For working at a Command-Line Interface (CLI), the tools in the oneAPI toolkits
are configured using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by
sourcing the ``setvars`` script every time you open a new terminal window. This
will ensure that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.


### Linux
Source the script from the installation location, which is typically in one of
these folders:


For root or sudo installations:


  ``. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh``


For normal user installations:

  ``. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh``

**Note:** If you are using a non-POSIX shell, such as csh, use the following command:

     ``$ bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'``

If environment variables are set correctly, you will see a confirmation
message.

If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the
Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system
checks to find missing dependencies and permissions errors.
[Learn more](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html).


**Note:** [Modulefiles scripts](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-modulefiles-with-linux.html)
    can also be used to set up your development environment.
    The modulefiles scripts work with all Linux shells.


**Note:** If you wish to fine
    tune the list of components and the version of those components, use
    a [setvars config file](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos/use-a-config-file-for-setvars-sh-on-linux-or-macos.html)
    to set up your development environment.

### Windows

Execute the  ``setvars.bat``  script from the root folder of your
oneAPI installation, which is typically:


  ``"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat"``


For Windows PowerShell* users, execute this command:

  ``cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'``


If environment variables are set correctly, you will see a confirmation
message.

If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the
Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system
checks to find missing dependencies and permissions errors.

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU,
FPGA) as well as whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI
Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands.
    ```
    $ cd bitonic-sort
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    make run
    ```

3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``

## Running the sample
### Application Parameters

        Usage: bitonic-sort <exponent> <seed>

where

exponent is a positive number. The according length of the sequence is 2**exponent.

seed is the seed used by the random generator to generate the randomness.

The sample offloads the computation to GPU and then performs the computation in serial in the CPU.
The results from the parallel and serial computation are compared. If the results are matched and
the ascending order is verified, the application will display a “Success!” message.

### Example of Output
```
$ ./bitonic-sort 21 47
Array size: 2097152, seed: 47
Device: Intel(R) Gen9 HD Graphics NEO
Warm up ...
Kernel time using USM: 0.248422 sec
Kernel time using buffer allocation: 0.253364 sec
CPU serial time: 0.628803 sec

Success!
```
