# `odd-Even MergeSort` Sample

This sample implements odd-even mergesort (also known as Batcher's sort) algorithm belonging to the class of sorting networks. While not efficient generally for large sequences compared to algorithms with better asymptotic algorithmic complexity (merge sort or radix sort), this may be the preferred algorithms of choice for sorting batches of short-sized to mid-sized (key, value) array pairs.

This `odd-even mergesort` sample is implemented using SYCL* standards for Intel&reg; CPUs and GPUs.

## Purpose

The odd-even mergesort algorithm was developed by K.E. Batcher. It is based on a merge algorithm that merges two sorted halves of a sequence to a completely sorted sequence.

In contrast to mergesort, this algorithm is not data-dependent, which means the same comparisons are performed regardless of the actual data. Therefore, odd-even mergesort can be implemented as a sorting network.

This sample is migrated from NVIDIA CUDA sample, see [NVIDIA Sample](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/2_Concepts_and_Techniques/sortingNetworks).

This sample contains three versions of the same program.

`sycl_dpct_migrated`: This version contains migrated code, using the Intel&reg; DPC++ Compatibility Tool, from CUDA code with manual changes for it to work functionally.

| Component 		| Description
|:---			|:---
| Common 		| Helper utility headerfiles
| src 			| DPCT migrated files(.cpp and .h)
| CMakeLists.txt 	| Build file

`sycl_dpct_output`: This version contains migrated code from the Intel&reg; DPC++ Compatibility Tool (with some APIs unmigrated) from CUDA code without manual change, so it is not functionally working and no build enabled.
| Component 		| Description
|:---			|:---
| Common 		| Helper utility headerfiles
| src 			| DPCT migrated files(.cpp and .h)

`sycl_migrated`: Thsi version contains manually migrated SYCL* compliant code from CUDA code.

| Component 		| Description
|:---			|:---
| common 		| Helper utility headerfiles
| src 			| Manually migrated files(.cpp and .h)
| CMakeLists.txt 	| Build file

## Key Implementation Details

SYCL* implementation is explained in the code using key features such as Cooperative Groups, Shared Memory and Data-Parallel concept.

In this implementation, a random sequence of power of 2 elements is given as input and the algorithm sorts the sequence in parallel. This algorithm sorts the first half of a list, and sort the second half separately, and then sort the odd-indexed entries and the even-indexed entries separately, then you need make only one more comparison-switch per pair of keys to completely sort the list.

In this algorithm, the input size is of array length 1048576. The code checks for all the input sizes in the intervals of 2th power from array length 64 to 1048576 calculated for one iteration.

Comparator swaps the value if top value is greater or equal to the bottom value.

## Building the `odd-even mergesort` Program for CPU and GPU

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html).


### On Linux*

Perform the following steps:
1.	Build the program with cmake using the following shell commands. From the root directory of the `odd-even-merge-sort` project:

	```
	$ mkdir build
	$ cd build
	$ cmake ..
	$ make
	```
	 This builds  `sycl_dpct_migrated` and `sycl_migrated` versions of the program.

2.	Run the program:

		Run sycl_dpct_migrated using following commands,
			$ make run_sdm_cpu  (for CPU device)
			$ make run_sdm_gpu  (for GPU device)

		Run sycl_migrated using following commands,
			$ make run_cpu
			$ make run_gpu

3.	Clean the program using:

	```
	$ make clean
	```

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running make with the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```

### Troubleshooting

If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the Diagnostics Utility for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors. See [Diagnostics Utility for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html).

### Running Samples In Intel&reg; DevCloud

If running a sample in the Intel&reg; DevCloud, you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit [Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/).

1. Open a terminal on your Linux system.

2. Log in to Intel&reg; DevCloud.
	```
	ssh devcloud
	```

3. Download the samples.
	```
	git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git
	```

4. Change directories to the `odd-even-merge-sort` sample directory.
	```
	cd ~/oneAPI-samples/DirectProgramming/DPC++/GraphTraversal/odd-even-merge-sort
	```
	
5. Build the sample on GPU node using
	```
	qsub  -I  -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 -d .
	```
>   **Note**: -I (Upper case I) is used for Interactive mode, -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 (lower case L) is used to assign one full GPU node to the job. Note: The -d . is used to 	          configure the current folder as the working directory for the task.

6. Perform the same steps similar to Linux system.
	
7. Clean-up the project files
	```	
	make clean
	```
	    
8. Disconnect from the Intel&reg; DevCloud.
	```
	exit
	```
