# `ISO2DFD` Sample

ISO2DFD: Intel® oneAPI Data Parallel C++ Language Basics Using 2D-Finite-Difference-Wave Propagation

The ISO2DFD sample refers to Two-Dimensional Finite-Difference Wave Propagation in Isotropic Media.  It is a two-dimensional stencil to simulate a wave propagating in a 2D isotropic medium and illustrates the basics of the DPC++ programming language using direct programming.

A complete code walk-through for this sample can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/code-sample-two-dimensional-finite-difference-wave-propagation-in-isotropic-media-iso2dfd)

## Purpose

ISO2DFD is a finite difference stencil kernel for solving the 2D acoustic isotropic wave equation.  In 
this sample, we chose the problem of solving a Partial Differential Equation (PDE), using a 
finite-difference method, to illustrate the essential elements of the DPC++ programming language: 
queues, buffers/accessors, and kernels. Use it as an entry point to start programming in DPC++ or as a 
proxy to develop or better understand complicated code for similar problems. 

Using Data Parallel C++, the sample will explicitly run on the GPU as well as CPU to calculate a 
result. The output will include GPU device name. The results from the two devices are compared and, if 
the sample ran correctly, report a success message. The output of the wavefield can be plotted using 
the SU Seismic processing library, which  has utilities to display seismic wavefields and can be 
downloaded from [John Stockwell’s SeisUnix GitHub](https://https://github.com/JohnWStockwellJr/SeisUnix/wiki/Seismic-Unix-install-on-Ubuntu)

## Key implementation details

SYCL implementation explained.  

* DPC++ queues (including device selectors and exception handlers).
* DPC++ buffers and accessors.  
* The ability to call a function inside a kernel definition and pass accessor arguments as pointers. A 
function called inside the kernel performs a computation (it updates a grid point specified by the 
global ID variable) for a single time step.

##  Building the `iso2dfd` Program for CPU and GPU

> Note: if you have not already done so, set up your CLI environment by sourcing  the setvars script located in the root of your oneAPI installation. 
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh  
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh  
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat

### Include Files 

The include folder is located at %ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include on your development system.

### Running Samples In DevCloud

If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, 
FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the [Intel® oneAPI 
Base Toolkit Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Perform the following steps:
1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands. 

   ```    
    cd iso2dfd_dpcpp &&  
    mkdir build &&  
    cd build &&  
    cmake .. &&  
    make -j 
    ```

2. Run the program on Gen9 

    ```
    make run  
    ```

3. Clean the program  
  
    ```
    make clean  
    ```

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
- Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
    - Right-click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
    - Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Rebuild.
    - From the top menu, select Debug -> Start without Debugging.

## Running the Sample
### Application Parameters 

You can  execute the code with different parameters. For example the following command will run the iso2dfd executable using a 1000x1000 grid size and it will iterate over 2000 time steps.

    ```
    ./iso2dfd 1000 1000 2000
    ```	
 	
   Usage: ./iso2dfd n1 n2 Iterations

	 n1 n2      : Grid sizes for the stencil
	 Iterations : Number of timesteps.
