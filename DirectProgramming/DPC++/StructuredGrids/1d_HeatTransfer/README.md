# `1D-Heat-Transfer` Sample

This code sample demonstrates the simulation of a one-dimensional heat transfer process using Intel Data Parallel C++. Kernels in this example are implemented as a discretized differential equation with the second derivative in space and the first derivative in time.

## Purpose

1D-Heat-Transfer is a DPC++ application that simulates the heat
propagation on a one-dimensional isotropic and homogeneous medium. The
following equation is used in the simulation of heat propagation:

dU/dt = k * d<sup>2</sup>U/dx<sup>2</sup>

Where:
dU/dt is the rate of change of temperature at a point.
k is the thermal diffusivity.
d<sup>2</sup>U/dx<sup>2</sup> is the second spatial derivative.

Or

U(i) = C * (U(i+1) - 2 * U(i) + U(i-1)) + U(i)

where constant C = k * dt / (dx * dx)

The code sample includes both parallel and serial calculations of heat
propagation. The code sample will attempt to execute on an
available GPU and fallback to the system's CPU if a compatible GPU is
not detected. The results are stored in a file.


## Key Implementation Details 

The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes a device
selector, buffer, accessor, USM allocation, kernel, and command
groups.

## Building the 1d_HeatTransfer Program for CPU and GPU

### Include Files  

The include folder is located at
`%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development
system".

### Running Samples In DevCloud

If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the [Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System  
  1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands. 
  
  ```
  $ cd 1d_HeatTransfer
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make -j
  ```

  2. Run the program
  
  ```
  $ make run  
  ```
  
  3. Clean the program  
  
  ```
  $ make clean
  ```
  
### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
- Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
    - Right-click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
    - Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Rebuild.
    - From the top menu, select Debug -> Start without Debugging.

- Build the program using MSBuild
     - Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017" or "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019"
     - Run the following command: `MSBuild 1d_HeatTransfer.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"`


## Running the sample
### Application Parameters   
	
        Usage: 1d_HeatTransfer <n> <i>

Where:

n is the number of points you want to simulate the heat transfer.

i is the number of timesteps in the simulation. 

To simulate 100 points for 1000 timesteps:

        ./1d_HeatTransfer 100 1000

The sample performs the computation serially on CPU, using DPC++
buffers, and using DPC++ USM. The DPC++ results are compared against
the serial version and saved to "usm_error_diff.txt" and
"buffer_error_diff.txt".  If the results match, the application will
display a “PASSED” message.
