# `ISO3DFD DPC++` Sample

The ISO3DFD sample refers to Three-Dimensional Finite-Difference Wave Propagation in Isotropic Media.  It is a three-dimensional stencil to simulate a wave propagating in a 3D isotropic medium and shows some of the more common challenges when targeting SYCL devices (GPU/CPU) in more complex applications.

## Purpose

ISO3DFD is a finite difference stencil kernel for solving the 3D acoustic isotropic wave equation which can be used as a proxy for propogating a seismic wave. Kernels in this sample are implemented as 16th order in space, with symmetric coefficients, and 2nd order in time scheme without boundary conditions.. Using Data Parallel C++, the sample can explicitly run on the GPU and/or CPU to propagate a seismic wave which is a compute intensive task.

The code will attempt first to execute on an available GPU and fallback to the system's CPU if a compatible GPU is not detected. By default, the output will print the device name where the DPC++ code ran along with the grid computation metrics - flops and effective throughput. For validating results, a serial version of the application will be run on CPU and results will be compared to the DPC++ version.

A detailed code walk through can be found at https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/explore-dpcpp-samples-from-intel/top.html#top_STEP4_ISO3DFD. 

## Key Implementation Details 

The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes includes the use of the following : 
* DPC++ local buffers and accessors (declare local memory buffers and accessors to be accessed and managed by each DPC++ workgroup)
* Code for Shared Local Memory (SLM) optimizations
* DPC++ kernels (including parallel_for function and nd-range<3> objects)
* DPC++ queues (including custom device selector and exception handlers)

## Building the `ISO3DFD` Program for CPU and GPU

> Note: if you have not already done so, set up your CLI 
> environment by sourcing  the setvars script located in 
> the root of your oneAPI installation. 
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh  
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh  
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat

### Include Files  
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system".  

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Perform the following steps:
1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands. 
``` 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```

> Note: by default, executable is build with kernel with direct global memory usage. You can build the kernel with shared local memory (SLM) buffers with the following:
```
cmake -DSHARED_KERNEL=1 ..
make -j
```

2. Run the program :
    ```
    make run
    ```
> Note: for selecting CPU as a SYCL device use `make run_cpu`

3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
```
* Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
      Right click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
      Right click on the project in Solution explorer and select Rebuild.
      From top menu select Debug -> Start without Debugging.

* Build the program using MSBuild
      Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017" or "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019"
      Run - MSBuild mandelbrot.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"
```

## Running the Sample
```
make run
```

### Application Parameters 
You can modify the ISO3DFD parameters from the command line.
