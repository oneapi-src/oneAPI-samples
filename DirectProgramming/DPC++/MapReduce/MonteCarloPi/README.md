# Monte Carlo Pi Sample

Monte Carlo Simulation is a broad category of computation which utlizes statistical analysis to reach a result. This sample utilizes the Monte Carlo Procedure to estimate the value of pi: By inscribing a circle of radius 1 inside a 2x2 square, and then sampling a large number of random coordinates falling uniformly within the square, the value of pi can be estimated using the ratio of samples which fall inside the circle divided by the total number of samples.

This method of estimation works for calculating pi because the expected value of the sample ratio is equal to the ratio of a circle's area divided by the square's: a circle of radius 1 has an area of pi units squared, while a 2x2 square has an area of 4 units squared, yielding a ratio of pi/4. Therefore, to estimate the value of pi, our solution will be 4 times the sample ratio.

## Purpose

The Monte Carlo procedure for estimating pi is easily parallelized, as each calculation of a random coordinate point can be considered a discrete work item. The computations involved with each work item are entirely independent of one another except for in summing the total number of points inscribed within the circle. This code sample demonstrates how to utilize the DPC++ reduction extension for this purpose.

The code will attempt first to execute on an available GPU and fallback to the system's CPU if a compatible GPU is not detected.  The device used for compilation is displayed in the output along with elapsed time to complete the computation. A rendered image plot of the computation is also written to a file.


## Key Implementation Details 

The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes device selector, buffer, accessor, kernel, and reduction.

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
Perform the following steps:
1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands. 
``` 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    make run
    ```

3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
* Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
      Right click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
      Right click on the project in Solution explorer and select Rebuild.
      From top menu select Debug -> Start without Debugging.

* Build the program using MSBuild
      Open "Intel oneAPI command prompt for Microsoft Visual Studio 2019" or "Intel oneAPI command prompt for Microsoft Visual Studio 2017"
      Run - MSBuild MonteCarloPi.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"


## Running the Sample

### Application Parameters
constexpr int size_n =
constexpr int size_wg =

constexpr int img_dimensions =
constexpr double circle_outline =

size_n defines the sample size for the monte carlo procedure. size_wg defines the size of workgroups inside the kernel code. The number of workgroups is calculated by the division of size_n by size_wg, so size_n must be greater than or equal to size_wg. increasing size_n will increase computation time as well as the accuracy of the pi estimation. Changing size_wg will have different performance effects depending on the device used for offloading.

- img_dimensions defines the size of the output image for data visualization.
- circle_outline defines the thickness of the circular border in the output image for data visualization. setting it to zero will remove it entirely.
