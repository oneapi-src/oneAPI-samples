## Purpose
This project is a template designed to help you quickly create your own Data Parallel C++ application for FPGA targets. The template assumes the use of CMake to build your application. The supplied `CMakeLists.txt` file contains the compiler options and libraries needed to compile a Data Parallel C++ application for FPGA targets. The `main.cpp` source file shows the header files you should include and the recommended "device selector" code for targeting your application's runtime device.

This is a project template only. It is recommended that you review the FPGA "Getting Started" code sample  [compile_flow](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/DPC%2B%2BFPGA/Tutorials/GettingStarted/fpga_compile), which explains the basic DPC++ FPGA workflow, compile targets, and compiler options.

## Building the `CMake based FPGA` Program

### Include Files
The include folder is located at %ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include on your development system.

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (cpu, gpu, fpga_compile, or fpga_runtime) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
The following instructions assume you are in the project's root folder. 

1. Create a `build` directory for `cmake` build artifacts:

    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    ```
2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * To build the template for FPGA Emulator (fast compile time, targets a CPU-emulated FPGA device), and then run it:

    ```
    make fpga_emu
    ./cmake.fpga_emu
    ```

   * To generate the FPGA optimization report (fast compile time, partial FPGA HW compile):

    ```
    make report
    ```
    Locate the FPGA optimization report, `report.html`, in the `fpga_report.prj/reports/` directory.

   * To build and run the template for FPGA Hardware (takes about one hour, the system must have at least 32 GB of physical dynamic memory):

    ```
    make fpga
    ./cmake.fpga
    ```
