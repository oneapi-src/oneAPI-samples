## Purpose
This project is a template designed to help you create your own Data Parallel C++ application for GPU targets. The template assumes the use of make to build your application. See the supplied `Makefile` file for hints regarding the compiler options and libraries needed to compile a Data Parallel C++ application for GPU targets. And review the `main.cpp` source file for help with the header files you should include and how to implement "device selector" code for targeting your application's runtime device.

## Key Implementation Details
The basic DPC++ project template for FPGA targets.

## Building the `Make based GPU` Program

### Include Files
The include folder is located at %ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include on your development system.

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
The following instructions assume you are in the root of the project folder.

To build the template using:
```
    make all or make build
```
To run the template using:
```
    make run
```
Clean the template using:
```
    make clean
```
