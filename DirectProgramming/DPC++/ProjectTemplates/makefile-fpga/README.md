## Purpose
This project is a template designed to help you quickly create your own Data Parallel C++ application for FPGA targets. The template assumes the use of make to build your application. The supplied `Makefile` file contains the compiler options and libraries needed to compile a Data Parallel C++ application for FPGA targets. The `main.cpp` source file shows the header files you should include and the recommended "device selector" code for targeting your application's runtime device.

This is a project template only. It is recommended that you review the FPGA "Getting Started" code sample  [compile_flow](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/DPC%2B%2BFPGA/Tutorials/GettingStarted/fpga_compile), which explains the basic DPC++ FPGA workflow, compile targets, and compiler options.

## Building the `Make based FPGA` Program

### Include Files
The include folder is located at %ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include on your development system.

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Linux* System
The following instructions assume you are in the project's root folder.

To build the template for FPGA Emulator (fast compile time, targets a CPU-emulated FPGA device):
  ```
  make build_emu
  ```

To generate an FPGA optimization report (fast compile time, partial FPGA HW compile):
  ```
  make report
  ```
Locate the FPGA optimization report, `report.html`, in the `fpga_report.prj/reports/` directory.

To build the template for FPGA Hardware (takes about one hour, the system must
have at least 32 GB of physical dynamic memory):
  ```
  make build_hw
  ```

To run the template on FPGA Emulator:
  ```
  make run_emu
  ```

To run the template on FPGA Hardware:
  ```
  make run_hw
  ```

To clean the build artifacts, use:
  ```
  make clean
  ```
