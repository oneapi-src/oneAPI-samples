## Purpose
This project is a template designed to help you create your own Data Parallel C++ application for GPU targets. The template assumes the use of make to build your application. Review the main.cpp source file for help with the header files you should include and how to implement "device selector" code for targeting your application's runtime device

If GPU is not available on your system, you can fallback to cpu or default device.

## Key Implementation Details
The basic DPC++ project template for FPGA targets.

## Building the `Visual Studio based GPU` Program

### Include Files
The include folder is located at %ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include on your development system.

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer
- Build the program using VS2017 or VS2019
    - Right-click on the solution file and open using either VS2017 or VS2019 IDE.
    - Right-click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Rebuild.
    - From the top menu, select Debug -> Start without Debugging.

- Build the program using MSBuild
     - Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2017" or "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019"
     - Run the following command: `MSBuild Hello_World_GPU.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"`
