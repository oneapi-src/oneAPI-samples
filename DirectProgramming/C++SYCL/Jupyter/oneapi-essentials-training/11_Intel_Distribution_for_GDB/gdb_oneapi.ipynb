    "\n",
    "Intel® Distribution for GDB* (*gdb-oneapi* executable) is part of the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit. It can be used to debug oneAPI applications written in several different languages targeting various different accelerator devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/gdb_overview.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Features\n",
    "* Multi-target: The debugger can orchestrate multiple targets for different architectures. This feature allows you to debug the \"host\" portion and the \"kernel\" of a DPC++ program in the same GDB* session.\n",
    "* Auto-attach: The debugger automatically creates an inferior that attaches itself to the Intel® Graphics Technology target to be able to receive events and control the GPU for debugging.\n",
    "* Thread and SIMD lanes: The debugger displays SIMD lane information for the GPU threads on the command line interface. You can switch among active threads and lanes.\n",
    "* Support for debugging a kernel offloaded to a CPU, GPU, or FPGA-emulation device.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does the Intel Distribution for GDB debug GPUs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compilation and Execution for Debug\n",
    "When debugging oneAPI applications with gdb-oneapi, debug information for the GPU needs to be generated and embedded in the application. The compilation and execution process looks like the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/gpu_debug.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Source code is compiled. Host code is compiled normally while kernel code is compiled with debug info into SPIR-V intermediate representation format embedded in the host binary.\n",
    "    * Use -g (generate debug info) and -O0 (disable optimization) compiler options to debug source.\n",
    "    * May use -O2 to debug optimized code at assembly level.\n",
    "    * Use same optimization level when linking, if compiling and linking separately.\n",
    "    * Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation also works with GPU debug and can be utilize to avoid JIT compilation everytime application is run.\n",
    "2. Launch appliction with `gdb-oneapi`\n",
    "    * `gdb-oneapi <your_app>`\n",
    "3. Application runtime compiles SPIR-V and debug info into ELF and DWARF formats.\n",
    "4. GPU kernel code is executed and debugged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inferiors for GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "GDB creates objects called *inferior*s to represent the state of each program execution. An inferior usually corresponds to a debugee process. For oneAPI applications, GDB will create one inferior for the native host target and additional inferiors for each GPU or GPU tile. When a GPU application is debugged, the debugger, by default, automatically launches a `gdbserver-gt` process to listen to GPU debug events. The `gdbserver-gt` target is then added to the debugger as an inferior.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/gdb_gpu_inferior.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "To see information about the inferiors while debugging. Use the `info inferiors` GDB command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging Threaded GPU SIMD Code\n",
    "\n",
    "GPU kernel code is written for a single work-item. When executing, the code is implicitly threaded and widened to vectors of work-items. In the Intel Distribution for GDB, variable locations are expressed as functions of the SIMD lane. The lane field is added to the thread representation in the form of `<inferior>.<thread>:<lane>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can use the `info threads` command to see information about the various active threads. The `thread` command can be used to switching among active threads and SIMD lanes. The `thread apply <thread>:<lane> <cmd>` command can be used to apply the specified command to the specified lanes.\n",
    "\n",
    "SIMD Lanes Support:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Only enabled SIMD lanes are displayed\n",
    "    * SIMD width is not fixed\n",
    "    * User can switch between enabled SIMD lanes\n",
    "    * After a stop, GDB switches to an enabled SIMD lane"
