    "# Common Parallel Patterns and Why?\n",
    "We need to recognize parallel patterns that have proven to be useful in the parallel programming space and apply the techniques that are time-tested to be the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, MapReduce framework is adopted for big data applications; its success stems largely from being based on two simple yet effective parallel patterns, map and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of common patterns in parallel programming that crop up occasionally, independent of the programming language that we’re using.\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns are versatile and can be employed at any level of parallelism (e.g., sub-groups, work-groups, full devices) and on any device (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, certain properties of the patterns (such as their scalability) may affect their suitability for different devices. We may be able to improve performance by selecting a different pattern entirely based on the selected device."

    "# Local Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, work-items need to share data and communicate with each other. On one hand, all work-items in all work-groups can access global memory, so data sharing and communication can occur through global memory. However, sharing and communication through global memory is less efficient, due to its lower bandwidth and higher latency. On the other hand, work-items in a sub-group that execute simultaneously in an execution unit (EU) thread can share data and communicate with each other very efficiently; however, the number of work-items in a sub-group is usually small and the scope of data sharing and communication is very limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory with higher bandwidth and lower latency that’s accessible to a bigger scope of work-items is very desirable for data sharing communication among work-items. The shared local memory (SLM) in GPUs is designed for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify kernel development and accelerate communication between work-items in a work-group, SYCL defines a special local memory space specifically for communication between work-items in a work-group.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"assets/localmem.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Each work-group may access variables in its own local memory space, but it cannot access variables in another work-group’s local memory. When a work-group begins , the contents of its local memory are uninitialized, and local memory does not persist after a work-group finishes executing. Because of these properties, local memory may only be used for temporary storage while a work-group is executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some devices, such as for many CPU devices, local memory is a software abstraction and is implemented using the same memory subsystems as global memory. On these devices, using local memory is primarily a convenience mechanism for communication. Some compilers may use the memory space information for compiler local memory its own local memory optimizations, but otherwise using local memory for communication will not fundamentally perform better than communication via global memory on these devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For other devices though, such as many GPU devices, there are dedicated resources for local memory, and on these devices, communicating via local memory will perform better than communicating through global memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the device query `info::device::local_mem_type` to determine whether an accelerator has dedicated resources for local memory or whether local memory is implemented as a software abstraction of global memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the device query `info::device::local_mem_size` to determine the size of local memory available for each work-group to access."

    "### Local Accessors\n",
    "\n",
    "A local accessor is used to declare local memory for use in an ND-range kernel. Like other accessor objects, a local accessor is constructed within a command group handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "A local accessor is created by specifying a type and a range describing the number of elements of that type. Like other accessors, local accessors may be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of defining local_accessor `localmem` with type _int_ and _one-dimension_ data\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "local_accessor<float, 2> localmem(range<2>(N, N), h);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The local accessor from one work-group can be accessed by all work-items within the work-group. Each work-group can have its own local accessor; a work-item from another work-group cannot access this local accessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Group Barrier\n",
    "\n",
    "When local accessor data is shared, work-group barriers are often required for work-item synchronization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `group_barrier` function synchronizes how each work-item views the state of memory. This type of synchronization operation is known as enforcing memory consistency or fencing memory. It ensures that the results of memory operations performed before the barrier are visible to other work-items after the\n",
    "barrier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `group_barrier` is usually required right after a local accessor is modified by a work-item so that it is synchronized for all work-items before the local accessor can be accessed.\n",

    "Below is an example of how a `group_barrier` function is defined to synchronize across all work-items within the work-group:\n",

    "* Tuning a reduction for different devices is a delicate balancing act between the time spent computing partial results and the time spent combining them; \n",

    "* Pack and unpack are also known as gather and scatter operations.\n",
    "* These operations handle differences in how data is arranged in memory and how\r",
    "we wish to present it to the compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PACK\n",
    "* The pack pattern,  discards elements of an input range based on a Boolean condition, packing the elements that are not discarded into contiguous locations of the output range.\n",
    "* This Boolean condition could be a precomputed mask or could be computed online by applying some function to each input element.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since pack depends on an exclusive scan, implementing a pack that applies to all elements of an ND-range must also take place via global memory and over the course of several kernel enqueues.\n",
    "* There is a common use case for pack that does not require the operation to be applied over all elements of an ND-range—namely, applying a pack only across items in a specific work-group or sub-group.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The example shown is based \r\n",
    "on a real kernel from molecular dynamics simulations: the work-items  n\r",
    "the sub-group assigned to particle i cooperate to identify all other particl s\r",
    "within a fixed distance of i, and only the particles in this “neighbor list” wi l\r",
    "be used to calculate the force acting on each particl\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pack pattern never reorders elements .\n",
    "* The elements that are packed into the output array appear in the same order as they did in the input.e.The code below demonstrates how such a pack operation could be used in a kernel to build a list of elements which require some additional postprocessing (in a future kernel). \n",
