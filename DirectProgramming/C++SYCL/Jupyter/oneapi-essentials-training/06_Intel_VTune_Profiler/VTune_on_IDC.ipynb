It does not require any local installation, but does have extra step of setting up SSH keys for Intel Developer Cloud so that you can start a reverse proxy to access VTune web UI.\n",

VTune collection is done using __cmd line on Intel Developer Cloud__ and the data is copied to local machine for analysis.
