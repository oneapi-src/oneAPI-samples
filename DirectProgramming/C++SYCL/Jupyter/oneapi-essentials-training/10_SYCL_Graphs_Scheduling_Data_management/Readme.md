## Purpose
The hands-on exercises demonstrates how to utilize USM and Buffers and accessors to apply Memory management and take control over data movement implicitly and explicitly, utilize different types of data dependences that are important for ensuring execution of graph scheduling. You will also learn to select the correct modes of dependences in Graphs scheduling.
