## Purpose
The set of hand-on exercises in this notebook demonstrates various aspects of Intel速 Advisor. The first uses Intel速 Advisor to show performance offload opportunities found in a sample application, and then additional command-line options for getting offload advisor results. The second, roofline analysis, gives an example of roofline analysis and command line options for getting advisor results. For both exercises, the results are rendered inside of the notebook. These notebooks are meant for exploration and familiarization, and do not require any code modification.
