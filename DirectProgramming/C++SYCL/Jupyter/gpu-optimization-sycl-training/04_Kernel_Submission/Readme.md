## Purpose
This Jupyter Notebook teaches GPU Optimization using SYCL with code examples that can be complied. Also, it familiarizes you with the use of Jupyter notebooks as a front-end for all training exercises. This workshop is designed to be used on the Devcloud and includes details on submitting batch jobs on the Devcloud environment.

## Install Directions

The training content can be accessed locally on the computer after installing necessary tools, or you can directly access using Intel DevCloud without any installation necessary.

#### Local Installation of JupyterLab and oneAPI Tools

The Jupyter Notebooks can be downloaded locally to computer and accessed:
- Install Jupyter Lab on local computer: [Installation Guide](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
- Install Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit on local computer: [Installation Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html) 
- git clone the repo and access the Notebooks using Jupyter Lab


#### Access using Intel DevCloud

The Jupyter notebooks are tested and can be run on Intel Devcloud without any installation necessary, 
below are the steps to access these Jupyter notebooks on Intel Devcloud:
1. Register on [Intel Devcloud](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi)
2. Login, Get Started and Launch Jupyter Lab
3. Open Terminal in Jupyter Lab and git clone the repo and access the Notebooks
