    "## Kernel Launch\n",
    "In SYCL, work is performed by enqueueing kernels into queues targeting specific devices. These kernels are submitted by the host to the device, executed by the device and results are sent back. The kernel submission by the host and the actual start of execution do not happen immediately - they are asynchronous and as such we have to keep track of the following timings associated with a kernel.\n",
    "#### Kernel submission start time\n",
    "This is the at which the host starts the process of submitting the kernel.\n",
    "#### Kernel submission end time\n",
    "This is the time at which the host finished submitting the kernel. The host performs multiple tasks like queuing the arguments, allocating resources in the runtime for the kernel to start execution on the device.\n",
    "#### Kernel launch time\n",
    "This is the time at which the kernel that was submitted by the host starts executing on the device. Note that this is not exactly same as the kernel submission end time. There is a lag between the submission end time and the kernel launch time, which depends on the availability of the device. It is possible for the host to queue up a number of kernels for execution before the kernels are actually launched for execution. More over, there are a few data transfers that need to happen before the actual kernel starts execution which is typically not accounted separately from kernel launch time.\n",
    "#### Kernel completion time\n",
    "This is the time at which the kernel finishes execution on the device. The current generation of devices are non-preemptive, which means that once a kernel starts, it has to complete its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like VTune™ Profiler (vtune), clIntercept, and zeIntercept provide a visual timeline for each of the above times for every kernel in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following simple example shows time being measured for the kernel execution since the time is measured after `wait`. This will involve the kernel submission time on the host, the kernel execution time on the device, and any data transfer times (since there are no buffers or memory, this is usually zero in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "The time before the `wait` measures the time it takes for the host to submit the kernel to the runtime. These overheads are highly dependent on the backend runtime being used and the processing power of the host."

    "```\n",
    "If the kernels are submitted to different queues that share the same context, the performance is similar to submitting it to one queue. The issue to note here is that when a kernel is submitted to a new queue with a different context, the JIT process compiles the kernel to the new device associated with the context. If this JIT compilation time is discounted, the actual execution of the kernels is similar.\n",

This will prevent the need to transfer the input buffers, but the memory footprint of the kernels will increase because all the output buffers have to be resident at the same time in the context, whereas earlier the same memory on the device could be used for the output buffers. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Avoid Redundant Queue Construction\n",
    "To execute kernels on a device, the user must create a queue, which references an associated context, platform, and device. These may be chosen automatically, or specified by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "A context is constructed, either directly by the user or implicitly when creating a queue, to hold all the runtime information required by the SYCL runtime and the SYCL backend to operate on a device. When a queue is created with no context specified, a new context is implicitly constructed using the default constructor. In general, creating a new context is a heavy duty operation due to the need for JIT compiling the program every time a kernel is submitted to a queue with a new context. For good performance one should use as few contexts as possible in their application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, a queue is created inside the loop and the kernel is submitted to this new queue. This will essentially invoke the JIT compiler for every iteration of the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try the 4 modifications and compare the performance numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the code and check the performance number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In case you need to create multiple queues, try to share the contexts among the queues. This will improve the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the code below you can change `sycl::queue q2;` to:\n",
    "   ```cpp\n",
    "   sycl::queue q2{ q1.get_context(), sycl::default_selector() };\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Another implementation is by moving the `q2` queue declaration outside the for-loop, which improves performance quite dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can also use the same `sycl::queue` `q1` inside the for-loop, instead of using `q2`\n"
