    "## USM vs Buffers\n",
    "SYCL offers several choices for managing memory on the device. This section discusses the performance tradeoffs, briefly introducing the concepts. For an in-depth explanation, see Data Parallel C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with other language features, the specification defines the behavior but not the implementation, so performance characteristics can change between software versions and devices. This guide provide best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Buffers\n",
    "A buffer is a container for data that can be accessed from a device and the host. The SYCL runtime manages memory by providing APIs for allocating, reading, and writing memory. The runtime is responsible for moving data between host and device, and synchronizing access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unified Shared Memory (USM)\n",
    "USM allows reading and writing of data with conventional pointers, in contrast to buffers where access to data is exclusively by API. USM has two commonly-used variants. Device allocations can only be accessed from the device and therefore require explicit movement of data between host and device. Shared allocations can be referenced from device or host, with the runtime automatically moving memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We illustrate the tradeoffs between choices by showing the same example program written with the three models. To highlight the issues, we use a program where a GPU and the host cooperatively compute, and therefore need to ship data back and forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by showing the serial computation below. Assume that we want to perform the loop at line 9 on the GPU and the loop on line 14 on the CPU. Both loops read and write the data array so data must move between host and GPU for each iteration of the loop in line 8."

    "### Performance Impact of Buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we show computation using buffers to manage data. A `buffer` is created and `parallel_for` executes the kernel. The kernel uses the `device_data` accessor to read and write data in `buffer_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the code does not specify the location of data. An `accessor` indicates when and where the data is needed, and the SYCL runtime moves the data to the device (if necessary) and then launches the kernel. The `host_accessor` indicates that the data will be read/written on the host. Since the kernel is also read/writing `buffer_data`, the `host_accessor` constructor waits for the kernel to complete and moves data to the host to perform the read/write. "

    "#### Performance Considerations - Buffers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, the data access `device_data[i]` appear to be simple array references, but they are implemented by the SYCL runtime with C++ operator overloading. The efficiency of accessor array references depends on the implementation. In practice, device code pays no overhead for overloading compared to direct memory references. The runtime does not know in advance which part of the buffer is accessed, so it must ensure all the data is on the device before the kernel begins. This is true today, but may change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is not currently true for the `host_accessor`. The runtime does not move all the data to the host. The array references are implemented with more complex code and are significantly slower than native C++ array references. While it is acceptable to reference a small amount of data, computationally intensive algorithms using `host_accessor` pay a large performance penalty and should be avoided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is concurrency. A `host_accessor` can block kernels that reference the same buffer from launching, even if the accessor is not actively being used to read/write data. Limit the scope that contains the `host_accessor` to the minimum possible."

    "### Performance Impact of USM Shared Allocations\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we show the same algorithm implemented with shared allocations. Data is allocated using `sycl::malloc_shared`. Accessors are not needed because USM-allocated data can be referenced with conventional allows pointers. Therefore, the array references can be implemented with simple indexing. The `parallel_for` ends with a wait to ensure the kernel finishes before the host accesses data. Similar to buffers, the SYCL runtime ensures that all the data is resident on the device before launching a kernel. And like buffers, shared allocations are not copied to the host unless it is referenced. The first time the host references data, there is an operating system page fault, a page of data is copied from device to host, and execution continues. Subsequent references to data on the same page execute at full speed. When a kernel is launched, all of the host-resident pages are flushed back to the device."

Array references are array references on the host, so it has neither the page faults overhead of shared allocations, nor the overloading overhead associated with buffers. Shared allocations only transfer data that the host actually references, with a memory page granularity. In theory, device allocations allow on-demand movement of any granularity. In practice, fine-grained, asynchronous movement of data can be complex and most programmers simply move the entire data structure once. The requirement for explicit data movement and synchronization makes the code more complicated, but device allocations can provide the best performance."
