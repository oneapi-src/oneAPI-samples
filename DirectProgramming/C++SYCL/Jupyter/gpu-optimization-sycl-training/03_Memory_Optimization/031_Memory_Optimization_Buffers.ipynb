    "## Buffer Accessor Modes\n",
    "In SYCL, a buffer provides an abstract view of memory that can be accessed by the host or a device. A buffer cannot be accessed directly through the buffer object. Instead, we must create an accessor object that allows us to access the buffer’s data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The access mode describes how we intend to use the memory associated with the accessor in the program. The accessor’s access modes are used by the runtime to create an execution order for the kernels and perform data movement. This will ensure that kernels are executed in an order intended by the programmer. Depending on the capabilities of the underlying hardware, the runtime can execute kernels concurrently if the dependencies do not give rise to dependency violations or race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For better performance, make sure that the access modes of accessors reflect the operations performed by the kernel. The compiler will flag an error when a write is done on an accessor which is declared as read_only. But the compiler does not change the declaration of an accessor form `read_write` to read if no write is done in the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following example shows a simple vector-add computation. A, B, and C buffers have access mode default which is `read_write`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read_write` access mode informs the runtime that the data needs to be available on the device before the kernel can begin executing and the data needs to be copied from the device to the host at the end of the computation."

    "## Optimizing Memory Movement Between Host and Device\n",
    "Buffers can be created using properties to control how they are allocated. One such property is `use_host_ptr`. This informs the runtime that if possible, the host memory should be directly used by the buffer instead of a copy. This avoids the need to copy the content of the buffer back and forth between the host memory and the buffer memory, potentially saving time during buffer creation and destruction. To take another case, when the GPU and CPU have shared memory, it is possible to avoid copies of memory through sharing of pages. But for page sharing to be possible, the allocated memory needs to have some properties like being aligned on page boundary. In case of discrete devices, the benefit may not be realized because any memory operation by the accelerator will have to go across PCIe or some other slower interface than the memory of the accelerator.\n",

So it is very important to avoid data transfers between host and device as much as possible. In some situations it may be required to bring the data that was computed by a kernel on the accelerator to the host and do some operation on it and send it back to the device for further processing. In such situation we will end up paying for the cost of device to host transfer and then again host to device transfer.\n",

    "Consider the following example, where one kernel produces data through some operation (in this case vector add) into a new vector. This vector is then transformed into another vector by applying a function on each value and then fed as input into another kernel for some additional computation. This form of computation is quite common and occurs in many domains where algorithms are iterative and output from one computation needs to be fed as input into another computation. One classic example is machine learning models which are structured as layers of computation and output of one layer is input to the next layer."

    "Instead of bringing the data to the host and applying the function to the data and sending it back to the device in the second kernel, you can create a kernel to execute this function on the device itself. This has the advantage of avoiding the round trip of data from device to host. This technique is shown in the example below, which is functionally the same as the code before. We now introduce a third kernel kernel3 that operates on the intermediate data in accum_buf in between kernel1 and kernel2."
