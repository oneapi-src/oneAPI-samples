# `Visual Mandelbrot` Sample

Mandelbrot is an infinitely complex fractal pattern that is derived from a
simple formula. This `Visual Mandelbrot` sample demonstrates how to use SYCL*-compliant code for offloading computations to a GPU (or other devices) and visualize it with the SDL2 library.

|:---                               |:---
| What you will learn               | How to offload the computation to GPU using the Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler and visualize the output.
| Time to complete                  | 15 minutes

## Purpose

This `Visual Mandelbrot` sample is a SYCL-compliant application that generates a fractal image by
initializing a matrix of 1024 x 1024, where the computation at each point (pixel)
is entirely independent of the computation at other points. The sample includes parallel implementation together with interactive visualization, which allows for looking into fractal pattern. The parallel implementation demonstrates the use of buffers and SDL2 graphics library.

| OS                                | Ubuntu* 18.04 <br>Windows* 10 or newer
| Hardware                          | Skylake with GEN9 or newer
| Software                          | Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler

## Key Implementation Details

The program attempts first to run on an available GPU, and it will fall back to the system CPU if it does not detect a compatible GPU.

The program creates a window and displays render of the Mandelbrot image.

The basic SYCL implementation explained in the code includes device selector,
buffer, accessor, kernel, and command groups.
The SDL implementation includes creating windows, renderer and texture, handling events and texture streaming.

## Build the `Visual Mandelbrot` Sample

### Setting Environment Variables
For working with the Command-Line Interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by
sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `$ bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - For Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
>For more information on environment variables, see "Use the setvars Script" for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

You can use [Modulefiles scripts](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-modulefiles-with-linux.html) to set up your development environment. The modulefiles scripts work with all Linux shells.

If you wish to fine tune the list of components and the version of those components, use
a [setvars config file](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos/use-a-config-file-for-setvars-sh-on-linux-or-macos.html) to set up your development environment.

### Include Files
The include folder is located on your development system at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include`.

### On Linux*
Perform the following steps:
1. Install SDL library `apt install libsdl2-dev`
2. Build the program.
   ```
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake ..
   $ make
   ```

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```

#### Troubleshooting
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the Diagnostics Utility for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors. See [Diagnostics Utility for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html).


### On Windows* Using Visual Studio*
- Build the program using VS2019 or later.
    - Right-click on the solution file and open using the IDE.
    - Right-click on the project in **Solution Explorer** and select **Rebuild**.
    - From the top menu, select **Debug** > **Start without Debugging**.

- Build the program using MSBuild.
     - Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2019" or "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS2022" or whatever is appropriate for your Visual Studio version.
     - Run the following command: `MSBuild MandelbrotSDL.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"`


## Run the Sample
1. Run the program (default uses buffers).
    ```
    make run
    ```
### Usage

Drag while holding LMB to move the image.
Use scroll to zoom in or out. 

### Modifying Application Parameters

You can modify some parameters in `MandelbrotSDL.cpp`. Adjust the parameters to see how performance varies. The configurable parameters are:

|Parameter |Description
|:--- |:---
|`windowWidth` |Window width. Default is 640
|`windowHeight` |Window height. Default is 480
|`width` |Number of cells. Default is 256 - has to be power of 2.
|`height` |Number of cells. Default is 1024 - has to be power of 2.
|`probability` |Default value is 10%.
