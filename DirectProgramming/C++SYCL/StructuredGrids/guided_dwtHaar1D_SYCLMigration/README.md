# `dwtHaar1D` Sample

The `dwtHaar1D` - Discrete Haar wavelet decomposition sample is a principled approach to finding a decomposition of 1D signals with a length which is a power of 2. The original CUDA* source code is migrated to SYCL for portability across GPUs from multiple vendors.

>**Note**: This sample is migrated from the NVIDIA CUDA sample. See the [dwtHaar1D](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/5_Domain_Specific/dwtHaar1D) sample in the NVIDIA/cuda-samples GitHub.

## Purpose

The `dwtHaar1D` sample is a 1D decomposition for Haar wavelet and signals. The parallel implementation demonstrates the use of concepts, such as

- Cooperative groups
- Shared Memory

> **Note**: The sample used the open-source SYCLomatic tool that assists developers in porting CUDA code to SYCL code. To finish the process, you must complete the rest of the coding manually and then tune to the desired level of performance for the target architecture. You can also use the Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool available to augment the Base Toolkit.

This sample contains two versions of the code in the following folders:

| Folder Name          | Description
|:---                  |:---
|`01_dpct_output`      | Contains the output of the SYCLomatic Tool used to migrate SYCL-compliant code from CUDA code. 
|`02_sycl_migrated`    | Contains migrated and cleaned-up SYCL code from CUDA code.

## Key Implementation Details

The basics of Wavelet transform is to decompose a signal into approximation (a) and detail (d) coefficients where the detail tends to be small or zero which allows/simplifies compression. The first step is to get the number of decompositions necessary to perform a full decomposition. i.e., getlevels function. The resulting signal consisting of the approximation coefficients is computed at the host and then processed in a subsequent step on the device kernel `dwtHaar1D`.
dwtHaar1D kernel computes partial wavelet decomposition on the GPU using a Haar basis. For each thread block the full decomposition is computed and then these results have to be combined.

>**Note**: Refer to [Workflow for a CUDA* to SYCL* Migration](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/training/cuda-sycl-migration-workflow.html) for general information about the migration workflow.

## CUDA source code evaluation
The `dwtHaar1D` CUDA sample implementation consists of dividing Large signals into sub-signals with 512 elements and the wavelet transform for these is computed with one block over 10 decomposition levels. 
The resulting signal consisting of the approximation coefficients at level X is then processed in a subsequent step on the device. 
This requires interblock synchronization which is only possible on the host side. Detail coefficients that have been computed are not further referenced during the decomposition so that they can be stored directly in their final position in global memory. 
The transform and its storing scheme preserve locality in the coefficients so that these writes are coalesced.
Approximation coefficients are stored in shared memory because they are needed to compute the subsequent decomposition step.
The topmost approximation coefficient for a sub-signal processed by one block is stored in a special global memory location to simplify the processing after the interblock synchronization.

## Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

## Migrate the Code Using SYCLomatic

For this sample, the SYCLomatic tool automatically migrates 100% of the CUDA code to SYCL. Follow these steps to generate the SYCL code using the compatibility tool.

1. Clone the required GitHub repository to your local environment.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git
   ```
2. Change to the dwtHaar1D sample directory.
   ```
   cd cuda-samples/Samples/5_Domain_Specific/dwtHaar1D/
   ```
3. Generate a compilation database with intercept-build.
   ```
   intercept-build make
   ```
   This step creates a JSON file named compile_commands.json with all the compiler invocations and stores the names of the input files and the compiler options.

4. Pass the JSON file as input to the Intel® SYCLomatic Compatibility Tool. The result is written to a folder named dpct_output. The `--in-root` specifies the path to the root of the source tree to be migrated. The `--gen-helper-function`  option will make a copy of the dpct header files/functions used in migrated code into the dpct_output folder as include folder. 
   ```
   c2s -p compile_commands.json --in-root ../../.. --gen-helper-function 
   ```

## Build and Run the `dwtHaar1D` Sample

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script at the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system-wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see *[Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html)*.

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program.
   ```
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake .. or ( cmake -D INTEL_MAX_GPU=1 .. ) or ( cmake -D NVIDIA_GPU=1 .. )
   $ make
   ```
   > **Note**:
   > - By default, no flags are enabled during the build which supports Intel® UHD Graphics, Intel® Gen9, Gen11, and Xeon CPU.
   > - Enable **INTEL_MAX_GPU** flag during build which supports Intel® Data Center GPU Max 1550 or 1100 to get optimized performance.
   > - Enable **NVIDIA_GPU** flag during the build which supports NVIDIA GPUs([oneAPI for NVIDIA GPUs](https://developer.codeplay.com/products/oneapi/nvidia/) plugin from 
   Codeplay is required to build for NVIDIA GPUs).
   >   

   By default, this command sequence will build the  `01_dpct_output` and `02_sycl_migrated` versions of the program.

4. Run the program.

   Run `01_dpct_output` on GPU.
   ```
   $ make run
   ```   
   Run `01_dpct_output` for CPU.
   ```
    $ export ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=opencl:cpu
    $ make run
    $ unset ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR
   ```
   
   Run `02_sycl_migrated` on GPU.

   ```

#### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the [Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html) for more information on using the utility.
