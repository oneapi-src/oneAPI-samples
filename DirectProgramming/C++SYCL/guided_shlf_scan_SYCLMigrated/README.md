# `guided_shfl_scal_migrated` Sample

This `guided_shfl_scal_migrated` sample demonstrates how to perform a scan operation across a thread block. The original CUDA source code is migrated to SYCL for portability across GPUs from multiple vendors.

| Category                      | Concepts and Functionality

## Purpose

The guided_shfl_scal_migrated sample shows how to perform a scan operation axross a thread block with the SYCL version of the CUDA shfl_scan, which is the shift_sub_group_right method.

> **Note**: We use Intel® open-sources SYCLomatic tool which assists developers in porting CUDA code automatically to SYCL code. To finish the process, developers complete the rest of the coding manually and then tune to the desired level of performance for the target architecture. User's can also use SYCLomatic Tool which comes along with the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit.

## Prerequisites

## Key Implementation Details

This sample contains two sets of sources in the following folders:

| Folder Name             | Description
|:---                     |:---
| `01_sycl_dpct_output`   | Contains output of Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool used to migrate SYCL-compliant code from CUDA code. <br> This SYCL code has some unmigrated or incorrectly generated code that has to be manually fixed before it is functional. (The code does not work as supplied.)
| `02_sycl_dpct_migrated` | Contains SYCL to CUDA migrated code generated by using the Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool with the manual changes implemented to make the code fully functional.

## Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

## Build the `guided_shfl_scal_migrated` Sample for CPU and GPU

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program.
   ```
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake ..
   $ make
   ```

   By default, this command sequence will build the `02_sycl_migrated` versions of the program.

## Run the 'guided_shfl_scal_migrated` Sample

### On Linux

Run the programs on a CPU or GPU. Each sample uses a default device, which in most cases is a GPU.

1. Run the samples in the `02_sycl_migrated` folder.
   ```
   make run
   ```

## Example Output

This is example output if you built the default and ran 'guided_shfl_scal_migrated'.

#### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the [Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/user-guide-diagnostic-utility/2024-0/overview.html) for more information on using the utility.
