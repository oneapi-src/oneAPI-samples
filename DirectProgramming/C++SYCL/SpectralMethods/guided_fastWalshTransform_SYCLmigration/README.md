# `Fast Walsh Transform` Sample

The Fast Walsh Transform demonstrates the efficient implementation of naturally-ordered Walsh transform (also known as Walsh-Hadamard or Hadamard transform) and its
particular application to dyadic convolution computation. The original CUDA* source code is migrated to SYCL for portability across GPUs from multiple vendors.

## Purpose

The sample shows the migration of fastWalshTransform from CUDA to SYCL using SYCLomatic tool.

>**Note**: We use Intel® open-sources SYCLomatic migration tool which assists developers in porting CUDA code automatically to SYCL code. To finish the process, developers complete the rest of the coding manually and then tune to the desired level of performance for the target architecture. Users can also use Intel® DPC++ Compatibility Tool which comes along with the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit.

This sample contains two versions in the following folders:

| Folder Name                   | Description
|:---                           |:---
| `01_dpct_output`              | Contains the output of the SYCLomatic tool used to migrate SYCL-compliant code from CUDA code. The tool completely migrates code but needs manual changes to get functional correctness on the given list of hardware.
| `02_sycl_migrated`            | Contains migrated SYCL code from CUDA code with manual changes.

## Key Implementation Details

This sample demonstrates the migration of the following CUDA features: 

- Shared memory
- Cooperative groups

>  **Note**: Refer to [Workflow for a CUDA* to SYCL* Migration](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/training/cuda-sycl-migration-workflow.html#gs.s2njvh) for general information about the migration workflow.

### CUDA source code evaluation

This code uses naturally(Hadamard)-ordered Fast Walsh Transform for batching vectors of arbitrary eligible lengths that are power of two in size. The FWT (fast walsh transform) is performed on GPU and compare with results on CPU. Also, there is a straightforward Walsh Transform which is used to test both CPU and GPU FWT
slow. The results would be validated with reference CPU FWT implementation by calculating the relative L2 norm.

This sample is migrated from NVIDIA CUDA sample. See the [fastWalshTransform](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/5_Domain_Specific/fastWalshTransform) sample in the NVIDIA/cuda-samples GitHub.

## Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

## Migrate the `fastWalshTransform` Sample

### Migrate the Code using SYCLomatic

For this sample, the SYCLomatic tool automatically migrates 100% of the CUDA runtime APIs to SYCL. Follow these steps to generate the SYCL code using the compatibility tool.

1. Clone the required GitHub repository to your local environment.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git
   ```
2. Change to the fastWalshTransform sample directory.
   ```
   cd cuda-samples/Samples/5_Domain_Specific/fastWalshTransform
   ```
3. Generate a compilation database with intercept-build
   ```
   intercept-build make
   ```
   The above step creates a JSON file named compile_commands.json with all the compiler invocations and stores the names of the input files and the compiler options.

4. Pass the JSON file as input to the SYCLomatic tool. The result is written to a folder named dpct_output. The `--in-root` specifies the path to the root of the source tree to be migrated. The `--gen-helper-function` option will make a copy of the dpct header files/functions used in migrated code into the dpct_output folder as `include` folder. 
   ```
   c2s -p compile_commands.json --in-root ../../.. --gen-helper-function
   ```

### Manual Workarounds 

1. CUDA code includes a custom API `findCUDADevice` in the helper_cuda file to find the best CUDA Device available.
```
    findCudaDevice (argc, (const char **) argv);
```
Since it's a custom API SYCLomatic tool will not act on it and we can either remove it or replace it with the `dpct get_device()` API to get device details.

2. While running the code on Intel(R) UHD Graphics P630 (gen9) GPU we get a runtime error as the number of work-items in each dimension of a work-group cannot exceed {256, 256, 256} for this device. To resolve this, adjust the macro value in fastWalshTransform_kernel.dp.hpp file
```
    #define ELEMENTARY_LOG2SIZE 10
```

## Build and Run the `fastWalshTransform` Sample

>  **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see *[Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html)*

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program.
   ```
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake .. or ( cmake -D INTEL_MAX_GPU=1 .. ) or ( cmake -D NVIDIA_GPU=1 .. )
   $ make
   ```
>**Note:** 
> - By default, no flags are enabled during the build which supports Intel® UHD Graphics, Intel® Gen9, Gen11, Xeon CPU.
> - Enable INTEL_MAX_GPU flag during build which supports Intel® Data Center GPU Max 1550 or 1100 to get optimized performance.
> - Enable NVIDIA_GPU flag during build which supports NVIDIA GPUs.([oneAPI for NVIDIA GPUs plugin from Codeplay](https://developer.codeplay.com/products/oneapi/nvidia/)  is required to build for NVIDIA GPUs)
   
By default, this command sequence will build the `sycl_migrated` versions of the program.

3. Run the code

   You can run the programs for CPU and GPU. The commands indicate the device target.

      Run `sycl_migrated` on GPU.
      ```
      make run
      ```
      Run `sycl_migrated` on CPU.
      ```
      export ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=cpu
      make run
      unset ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR
      ```
#### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the [Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/user-guide-diagnostic-utility/2024-0/overview.html) for more information on using the utility.
