# `QuasirandomGenerator` Sample
 
The `QuasirandomGenerator` sample implements Niederreiter Quasirandom Sequence Generator and Inverse Cumulative Normal Distribution functions for the generation of Standard Normal Distributions.

| Property                  | Description
|:---                       |:---
| What you will learn       | Migrating and optimizing QuasirandomGenerator from CUDA to SYCL
| Time to complete          | 15 minutes

## Purpose

The sample is based on the Niederreiter sequence, which is a type of low-discrepancy sequence that has better properties than pseudorandom sequences for certain applications, such as Monte Carlo integration.

> **Note**: We use Intel® open-sources SYCLomatic tool which assists developers in porting CUDA code automatically to SYCL code. To finish the process, developers complete the rest of the coding manually and then tune to the desired level of performance for the target architecture. User's can also use SYCLomatic Tool which comes along with the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit.

This sample contains two versions in the following folders:

| Folder Name                   | Description
|:---                           |:---
| `01_dpct_output`              | Contains output of SYCLomatic Tool used to migrate SYCL-compliant code from CUDA code. This SYCL code has some unmigrated code that has to be manually fixed to get full functionality. (The code does not functionally work as supplied.)
| `02_sycl_migrated_optimized`            | Contains the optimized sycl code.

### Workflow For CUDA to SYCL migration

Refer [Workflow](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/training/cuda-sycl-migration-workflow.html#gs.s2njvh) for details.

### CUDA source code evaluation

This is a program in CUDA that tests the performance of a quasi-random number generator. It generates a sequence of random numbers and compares it to a reference sequence generated by the CPU. The program prints the L1 norm of the difference between the two sequences, which is a measure of the accuracy of the GPU-generated sequence.
The program uses the CUDA runtime and some helper functions from the CUDA samples, as well as the Moro inverse cumulative normal distribution function. It also includes some CPU functions to initialize the quasi-random generator and to generate a quasi-random sequence using a 63-bit integer index.

This sample is migrated from NVIDIA CUDA sample. See the [quasirandomGenerator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples/tree/master/Samples/5_Domain_Specific/quasirandomGenerator) sample in the NVIDIA/cuda-samples GitHub.

## Key Implementation Details

This sample demonstrates the migration of the following prominent CUDA feature: 
- Constant Memory

## Build the `QuasirandomGenerator` Sample for CPU and GPU

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI

> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html).

## Tool assisted migration – SYCLomatic 

For this sample, the SYCLomatic Tool automatically migrates 100% of the CUDA code to SYCL. Follow these steps to generate the SYCL code using the compatibility tool:

1. git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git
2. cd cuda-samples/Samples/5_Domain_Specific/quasirandomGenerator/
3. Generate a compilation database with intercept-build
   ```
   intercept-build make
   ```
4. The above step creates a JSON file named compile_commands.json with all the compiler invocations and stores the names of the input files and the compiler options.
5. Pass the JSON file as input to the Intel® SYCLomatic Compatibility Tool. The result is written to a folder named dpct_output. The --in-root specifies path to the root of the source tree to be migrated.
   ```
   c2s -p compile_commands.json --in-root ../../.. --use-custom-helper=api
   ```
## Optimizations

SYCL has two kinds of queues that a programmer can create and use to submit kernels for execution:

  #### In-order queues: 
  Where kernels are executed in the order they were submitted to the queue.
   
 #### Out-of-order queues: 
 Where kernels can be executed in an arbitrary order (subject to the dependency constraints among them).

The choice to create an in-order or out-of-order queue is made at the queue construction time through the property sycl::property::queue::in_order(). By default, when no property is specified, the queue is out-of-order.

The optimized code creates the queue as follows:
        
        sycl::queue q_ct1 = sycl::queue(sycl::default_selector_v);

Since we changed the queue from in-order to out-of-order execution, it resulted in better performance.

To summarise, in-order queues guarantee the order of execution of commands, while out-of-order queues allow for greater flexibility and potential performance gains but require careful synchronization management. The choice of which queue to use depends on the requirements and constraints of the application being developed.

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program.
   ```
   $ mkdir build
   $ cd build
   $ cmake ..
   $ make
   ```

   By default, this command sequence will build the `01_dpct_output`, `02_sycl_migrated_optimized` version of the program.

3. Run the program.
   
   Run `01_dpct_output` on GPU.
   ```
   make run
   ```  
   Run `01_dpct_output` on CPU.
   ```
   export ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=cpu
   make run
   unset ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR 
   ```
 4. Run the program.
   
   Run `02_sycl_migrated_optimized` on GPU.
   ```
   make run_smo
   ```  
   Run `02_sycl_migrated_optimized` on CPU.
   ```
   export ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=cpu
   make run_smo
   unset ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR 
   ```
   
#### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the [Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html) for more information on using the utility.
