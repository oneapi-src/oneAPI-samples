# `Simple Add` Sample

The `Simple Add` sample demonstrates the simplest programming methods for using SYCL*-compliant buffers and Unified Shared Memory (USM). Additionally, building and running this sample verifies that your development environment is configured correctly for [Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html).

| Property            | Description
|:---                 |:---
| What you will learn | How to use SYCL*-compliant extensions to offload computations using both buffers and USM.
| Time to complete    | 15 minutes
| Category            | Getting Started

## Purpose

The `Simple Add` sample is a simple program that adds two large vectors of integers and verifies the results. In this sample, you will see how to use the most basic code in C++ language that offloads computations to a GPU, which includes using USM and buffers.

The basic SYCL implementations explained in the sample includes device selector,
USM, buffer, accessor, kernel, and command groups.

>**Note**: See the `Base: Vector Add` sample to examine another getting started sample you can use to learn more about using the Intel® oneAPI Toolkits to develop SYCL-compliant applications for CPU, GPU, and FPGA devices.

## Prerequisites

| Optimized for      | Description
|:---                |:---
| OS                 | Ubuntu* 18.04 <br> Windows* 10
| Hardware           | GEN9 or newer <br> Intel® Agilex® 7, Arria® 10, and Stratix® 10 FPGAs
| Software           | Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler


> **Note**: Even though the Intel DPC++/C++ OneAPI compiler is enough to compile for CPU, GPU, FPGA emulation, generating FPGA reports and generating RTL for FPGAs, there are extra software requirements for the FPGA simulation flow and FPGA compiles.
>
> For using the simulator flow, Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition and one of the following simulators must be installed and accessible through your PATH:
> - Questa*-Intel® FPGA Edition
> - Questa*-Intel® FPGA Starter Edition
> - ModelSim® SE
>
> When using the hardware compile flow, Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition must be installed and accessible through your PATH.
> **Warning** Make sure you add the device files associated with the FPGA that you are targeting to your Intel® Quartus® Prime installation.

## Key Implementation Details

This sample provides examples of both buffers and USM implementations for simple side-by-side comparison.

- USM requires an explicit wait for the asynchronous kernel's
computation to complete.
- Buffers, at the time they go out of scope, bring main
memory in sync with device memory implicitly. The explicit wait on the event is
not required as a result.

The program attempts first to run on an available GPU, and it will fall back to the system CPU if it does not detect a compatible GPU. If the program runs successfully, the name of the offload device and a success message is displayed.

## Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

## Build the `Simple Add` Program

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see *[Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html)* or *[Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html)*.

### Using Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
1. Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
2. Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
3. Open a terminal in VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**).
4. Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see the
*[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html)*.

   cd build
   cmake .. -DUSM=1
   ```

   > **Note**: When building for FPGAs, the default FPGA family will be used (Intel® Agilex® 7).
   > You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the *[Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html)* for more information on using the utility.

### Build and Run the `Simple Add` Sample in Intel® DevCloud (Optional)

When running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode.

>**Note**: Since Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI includes the appropriate development environment already configured, you do not need to set environment variables.

Use the Linux instructions to build and run the program.

You can specify a GPU node using a single line script.

```
qsub  -I  -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 -d .
```

- `-I` (upper case I) requests an interactive session.
- `-l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2` (lower case L) assigns one full GPU node.
- `-d .` makes the current folder as the working directory for the task.

  |Available Nodes           |Command Options
  |:---                      |:---
  |GPU	                     |`qsub -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 -d .`
  |CPU	                     |`qsub -l nodes=1:xeon:ppn=2 -d .`
  |FPGA Compile Time         |`qsub -l nodes=1:fpga_compile:ppn=2 -d .`
  |FPGA Runtime (Arria 10)   |`qsub -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:arria10:ppn=2 -d .`


>**Note**: For more information on how to specify compute nodes, read *[Launch and manage jobs](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/job-submission/)* in the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI Documentation.

Only `fpga_compile` nodes support compiling to FPGA. When compiling for FPGA hardware, increase the job timeout to **24 hours**.

Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on `fpga_runtime` nodes of the appropriate type, such as `fpga_runtime:arria10`.

Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI [*Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started*](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/) page.
