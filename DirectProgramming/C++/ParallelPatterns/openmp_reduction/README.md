# `openmp_reduction` Sample

The `openmp_reduction` code sample is a simple program that calculates pi.  This program is implemented using C++ and openMP for Intel(R) CPU and accelerators.

For comprehensive instructions see the [DPC++ Programming](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi-programming-guide) and search based on relevant terms noted in the comments.

## Purpose
This example demonstrates how to do reduction by using the CPU in
serial mode, the CPU in parallel mode (using OpenMP), the GPU using OpenMP
offloading.

All the different modes use a simple calculation for Pi. It is a well known
mathematical formula that if you integrate from 0 to 1 over the function, (4.0
/ (1+x*x) )dx, the answer is pi. One can approximate this integral by summing
up the area of a large number of rectangles over this same range.

Each of the different functions calculates pi by breaking the range into many
tiny rectangles and then summing up the results.

## Key Implementation Details
This code shows how to use OpenMP on the CPU host
as well as using target offload capabilities.

## Building the dpc_reduce program for CPU and GPU

### Include Files
The include folder is located at
`%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system".

### Running Samples In DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud,
remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to
run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the
[Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to
this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On a Linux* System

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

Perform the following steps:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Build the program using the following make commands
```
make
```
Run the program using:
```
make run
```
    or
```
src/openmp_reduction
```
Clean the program using:
```
make clean
```

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
