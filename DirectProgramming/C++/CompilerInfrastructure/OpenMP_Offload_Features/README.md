# OpenMP Offload Features

These examples demonstrate some of the new OpenMP Offload features supported
by the Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.

For more information on the compiler see the
[Intel&reg oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler Landing Page](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/dpc-compiler.html).

by the Intel oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.


## Key Implementation Details

The table below shows the designs and the demonstrated feature(s).

| Design                           | Feature(s) Utilized
| :---                             |:---
| class_member_functor             | Usage of functor in an OpenMP offload region
| function_pointer                 | Function called through a function pointer in an offload region
| user_defined_mapper              | Usage of the user defined mapper feature in target region map clauses

### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.


## Building the Program

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).


### Running Samples In DevCloud

If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the
compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode.
For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide
(https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/baseToolkitSamples/)


### On a Linux* System

Perform the following steps:

1. Build the program
	```
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
	```

2. Run the program:
    ```
    make run_prog1
    make run_prog2
    make run_prog3
    make run_prog4
    ```

3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

If an error occurs, troubleshoot the problem using the Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits.
