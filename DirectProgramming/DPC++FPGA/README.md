# oneAPI Samples for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)

The folders in this area of the oneAPI-sample GitHub repository include tutorials, reference designs, and libraries specific to field programmable gate array (FPGA) features.

You will need the following toolkits and add-ons:

- [Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit (Base Kit)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit.html), specifically the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.
- [Intel® FPGA Add-On for oneAPI Base Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fpga.html).
- Optionally, you might need access to [Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/).

>**Note**: The latest versions of code samples on the master branch are not guaranteed to be stable. Use a [stable release version](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tags) of the repository that corresponds to the version of the compiler you are using.

### Understand FPGA Programming

The *Introduction To FPGA Design Concepts* section of the [FPGA Optimization Guide for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide) contains information on the basic concepts that are foundational to FPGA programming. Read that section to get the most from these FPGA samples.

## Build and Run the Samples on Local Development System

Each sample contains a `README.md` file with instructions to build and run the sample. The following sections contain information about configuring your development environment to build and run the samples; in most cases, the sample `README.md` file contains specific instructions.

### Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

>**Note**: For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Include Files

All the FPGA code samples include the `dpc_common.hpp` header. The include folder is at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system. You might need to use some of the resources from this location to build the sample.

>**Note**: You can get the common resources from the [oneAPI-samples](/common) GitHub repository.

### Use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 1. Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 2. Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 3. Open a terminal in VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**).
 4. Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using instructions for Linux.
 5. (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the Generate Launch Configurations extension.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see the 
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).


### Use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run the sample using the Eclipse* IDE (Linux*) and Microsoft Visual Studio* (Windows*). For  on using the IDE integration, see [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide.html).


### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs when compiling a sample, you can get more details by running `make` with the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``

If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the [Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html) for more information on using the utility.



## Build and Run the Samples on Intel® DevCloud (Optional)

When running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode.

You can specify a FPGA runtime node using a single line script similar to the following example.

```
qsub -I -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2 -d .
```

- `-I` (upper case I) requests an interactive session.
- `-l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2` (lower case L) assigns one full node.
- `-d .` makes the current folder as the working directory for the task.

  |Available Nodes    |Command Options
  |:---               |:---
  |FPGA Compile Time  |`qsub -I -l nodes=1:fpga_compile:ppn=2 -d .`
  |FPGA Runtime       |`qsub -I -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2 -d .`
  |GPU	              |`qsub -I -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 -d .`
  |CPU	              |`qsub -I -l nodes=1:xeon:ppn=2 -d .`

>**Note**: For more information on how to specify compute nodes read, [Launch and manage jobs](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/job-submission/) in the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI Documentation.

Only `fpga_compile` nodes support compiling to FPGA. When compiling for FPGA hardware, increase the job timeout to 12 hours.

Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on `fpga_runtime` nodes of the appropriate type, such as `fpga_runtime:arria10` or `fpga_runtime:stratix10`.

Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the [Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/).

>**Note**: Since Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI includes the appropriate development environment already configured for you, you do not need to set environment variables.
