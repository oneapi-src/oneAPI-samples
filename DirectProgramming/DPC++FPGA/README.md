# oneAPI Samples for FPGAs

This part of the repository is dedicated to samples when targetting FPGAs.
These require the Intel® oneAPI DPC++ Compiler as well as the Intel® FPGA Add-On for oneAPI Base Toolkit.

The latest versions of code samples on the master branch are not guaranteed to be stable. 
Use a [stable release version](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tags) of the repository that corresponds to the version of the compiler you are using.

## Repository Structure

This folder is organized as follows:
- **Tutorials**
  - **GettingStarted**: basic samples to get you through your first compiles
  - **Features**: each sample in this folder demonstrates a compiler feature is isolation (such as loop unrolling)
  - **DesignPatterns**: each sample in this folder shows coding patterns that generates more efficient hardware
  - **Tools**: samples showing external debugging tools in action (profiling)
- **ReferenceDesigns**: Showcases high performance designs that take advantage of multiple features and design patterns shown in the Tutorials
- **include**: a set of commonly used functions wrapped up as libraries
