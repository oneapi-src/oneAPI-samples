# Host Pipes
This FPGA tutorial demonstrates how to use pipes to send and receive data between a host and a device. Pipes are a first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer construct that provide links between elements of a design. Access pipes through read and write application programming interfaces (APIs), without the notion of a memory address or pointer to elements within the FIFO. Pipes that connect a host and a device are referred to as host pipes.

## Purpose

Use host pipes to move data between the host part of a design and a kernel that resides on the FPGA. A read and write API imposes FIFO ordering on accesses to this data. The advantage to this approach is that you do not need to write code to address specific locations in these buffers when accessing the data. Host pipes provide a "streaming" interface between host and FPGA, and are best used in designs where random access to data is not needed or wanted.

#### Prototype Implementation

The host pipe implementation in oneAPI 2022.3 is a prototype implementation that relies on experimental features that are not incorporated into the standard inter-kernel pipes that are already supported. To separate the host pipe implementation from the existing inter-kernel pipe implementation, host pipes in this oneAPI version are declared in a different namespace than inter-kernel pipes. This namespace is as follows:

```c++
cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype
```

Additionally, the oneAPI 2022.3 prototype implementation of host pipes relies on Unified Shared Memory (USM). Only boards and devices that support USM can be used with host pipes in this release.

### Declaring a Host Pipe
Each individual host pipe is a function scope class declaration of the templated pipe class. The first template parameter should be a user-defined type that differentiates this particular pipe from the others. The second template parameter defines the datatype of each element carried by the pipe. The third template parameter defines the pipe capacity, which is the guaranteed minimum number of elements of datatype that can be held in the pipe. In other words, for a given pipe with capacity `c`, the compiler guarantees that operations on the pipe will not block due to capacity as long as, for any consecutive `n` operations on the pipe, the number of writes to the pipe minus the number of reads does not exceed `c`.

```c++
// unique user-defined types
class FirstPipeT;
class SecondPipeT;

// two host pipes 
using FirstPipeInstance = cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype::pipe<
    // Usual pipe parameters
    FirstPipeT, // An identifier for the pipe
    int,        // The type of data in the pipe
    8,          // The capacity of the pipe
    // Additional host pipe parameters
    kReadyLatency,                   // Latency for ready signal deassert
    kBitsPerSymbol,                  // Symbol size on data bus
    true,                            // Exposes a valid on the pipe interface
    false,                           // First symbol in high order bits
    protocol_name::AVALON_STREAMING  // Protocol
    >;
using SecondPipeInstance = cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype::pipe<
    // Usual pipe parameters
    SecondPipeT, // An identifier for the pipe
    int,         // The type of data in the pipe
    4,           // The capacity of the pipe
    // Additional host pipe parameters
    kReadyLatency,                   // Latency for ready signal deassert
    kBitsPerSymbol,                  // Symbol size on data bus
    true,                            // Exposes a valid on the pipe interface
    false,                           // First symbol in high order bits
    protocol_name::AVALON_STREAMING  // Protocol
    >;
```

In this example, `FirstPipeT` and `SecondPipeT` are unique user-defined types that identify two host pipes. The first host pipe (which has been aliased to `FirstPipeInstance`), carries `int` type data elements and has a capacity of `8`. The second host pipe (`SecondPipeInstance`) carries `float` type data elements, and has a capacity of `4`. The other host pipe parameters beyond these three have been set to default values. For a description of all host pipe parameters, refer to the [oneAPI Programming Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/). Using aliases allows these pipes to be referred to by a shorter and more descriptive handle, rather than having to repeatedly type out the full namespace and template parameters.

#### Additional template parameters

Host pipes use additional template parameters beyond the three described above. The use of these parameters is beyond the scope of this tutorial; their definitions and usage can be found in the [oneAPI SYCL FPGA Optimization Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide). Suitable values for these parameters consistent with non-specialized host pipe usage have been used in the accompanying tutorial code.

### Host Pipe API

Host Pipes expose read and write interfaces that allow a single element to be read or written in FIFO order to the pipe. These read and write interfaces are static class methods on the templated classes described in the Declaring a Host Pipe section above, and are described below.

Host pipes expose read and write interfaces that allow a single element to be read or written in FIFO order to the pipe. These read and write interfaces are static class methods on the templated classes that are described in the [Declaring a Host Pipe](#declaring-a-host-pipe) section. The API provides the following interfaces:
  
  - [Blocking write interface](#blocking-write)
  - [Non-blocking write interface](#non-blocking-write)
  - [Blocking read interface](#blocking-read)
  - [Non-blocking read interface](#non-blocking-read)

#### Blocking Write

The host pipe write interface writes a single element of the given datatype (`int` in the examples below) to the host pipe. On the host side, this class method takes a SYCL* device queue argument as its first argument, and the element being written as its second argument.

```c++
queue q(...);
...
int data_element = ...;

// blocking write from host to pipe
FirstPipeInstance::write(q, data_element);
```

In the FPGA kernel, writes to a host pipe take a single argument, which is the element being written.

```c++
float data_element = ...;

// blocking write from device to pipe
SecondPipeInstance::write(data_element);
```

#### Non-blocking Write
 
Non-blocking writes add a `bool` argument in both host and device APIs that is passed by reference and returns true in this argument if the write was successful, and false if it was unsuccessful. 

On the host:

```c++
queue q(...);
...
int data_element = ...;

// variable to hold write success or failure
bool success = false;

// attempt non-blocking write from host to pipe until successful
while (!success) FirstPipeInstance::write(q, data_element, success);
```

On the device:

```c++
float data_element = ...;

// variable to hold write success or failure
bool success = false;

// attempt non-blocking write from device to pipe until successful
while (!success) SecondPipeInstance::write(data_element, success);
```

#### Blocking Read
 
The host pipe read interface reads a single element of given datatype from the host pipe. Similar to write, the read interface on the host takes a SYCL* device queue as a parameter. The device read interface consists of the class method read call with no arguments. 

On the host:

```c++
// blocking read in host code
float read_element = SecondPipeInstance::read(q);
```

On the device:

```c++
// blocking read in device code
int read_element = FirstPipeInstance::read();
```

#### Non-blocking Read

Similar to non-blocking writes, non-blocking reads add a `bool` argument in both host and device APIs that is passed by reference and returns true in this argument if the read was successful, and false if it was unsuccessful. 

On the host:

```c++
// variable to hold read success or failure
bool success = false;

// attempt non-blocking read until successful in host code
float read_element;
while (!success) read_element = SecondPipeInstance::read(q, success);
```

On the device:

```c++
// variable to hold read success or failure
bool success = false;

// attempt non-blocking read until successful in device code
int read_element;
while (!success) read_element = FirstPipeInstance::read(success);
```

### Host pipe connections

Host pipe connections for a particular host pipe are inferred by the compiler from the presence of read and write calls to that host pipe in your code. A host pipe can be connected from the host only to a single kernel. That is, host pipe calls for a particular host pipe must be restricted to the same kernel. Host pipes can also only operate in one direction. That is, host-to-kernel or kernel-to-host. Host code for a particular host pipe can contain either only all writes or only all reads to that pipe, and the corresponding kernel code for the same host pipe can consist only of the opposite transaction.

### Testing the Tutorial
In `hostpipes.cpp`, two host pipes are declared for transferring host-to-device data (`H2DPipe`) and device-to-host data (`D2HPipe`).

```c++
using H2DPipe = cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype::pipe<H2DPipeID, ValueT, kPipeMinCapacity, kReadyLatency, kBitsPerSymbol, true, false, protocol_name::AVALON_STREAMING>;
using D2HPipe = cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype::pipe<D2HPipeID, ValueT, kPipeMinCapacity, kReadyLatency, kBitsPerSymbol, true, false, protocol_name::AVALON_STREAMING>;
```

These host pipes are used to transfer data to and from `SubmitLoopBackKernel`, which reads a data element from the H2DPipe (parameterized in the kernel template as `InHostPipe`), processes it using the `SomethingComplicated()` function (a placeholder example of offload computation), and writes it back to the host via `D2HPipe` (template parameter `OutHostPipes`).

```c++
template<typename KernelId, typename InHostPipe, typename OutHostPipe>
event SubmitLoopBackKernel(queue& q, size_t count) {
  return q.single_task<KernelId>([=] {
    for (size_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      auto d = InHostPipe::read();
      auto r = SomethingComplicated(d);
      OutHostPipe::write(r);
    }
  });
}
```

The SubmitLoopBackKernel is exercised in two different ways: an alternating read-write test, and a launch-collect test. In the former case, the host writes an element to be processed into the H2DPipe, and immediately attempts to read this result from the D2HPipe. When this read is successful, the next iteration of the loop can proceed to write the next element to be processed to the H2DPipe. This minimizes the capacity needed for both host pipes, as each pipe will hold at most one element at a time.
The `SubmitLoopBackKernel` is exercised in two different ways: an alternating read-write test and a launch-collect test. In the former case, the host writes an element to be processed into `H2DPipe`, and immediately attempts to read this result from `D2HPipe`. When this read is successful, the next iteration of the loop can proceed to write the next element to be processed to `H2DPipe`. This configuration minimizes the capacity needed for both host pipes, as each pipe holds at most one element at a time.

```c++
  for (size_t r = 0; r < repeats; r++) {
    std::cout << "\t " << r << ": " << "Doing " << count << " writes & reads" << std::endl;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      H2DPipe::write(q, in[i]);
      out[i] = D2HPipe::read(q);
    }
  }
```

In the latter launch-collect test, the entire contents of the `in` vector are written to `H2DPipe` before the results are read from `D2HPipe`. For a pipelined kernel, this sequence has the advantage of pipeline parallelizing the offloaded computation on each input data element. However, this sequence can increase the capacity requirements for `H2DPipe`, `D2HPipe` or both. Since all of the input data elements are written to `H2DPipe` before any are read out of `D2HPipe`, the total capacity of the two pipes plus the kernel datapath must be greater than the total number of input elements.

```c++
  for (size_t r = 0; r < repeats; r++) {
    std::cout << "\t " << r << ": " << "Doing " << count << " writes" << std::endl;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      H2DPipe::write(q, in[i]);
    }

    std::cout << "\t " << r << ": " << "Doing " << count << " reads" << std::endl;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      out[i] = D2HPipe::read(q);
    }
  }
```

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If you are running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are supported only on `fpga_compile` nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is supported only on `fpga_runtime` nodes of the appropriate type, such as `fpga_runtime:arria10` or `fpga_runtime:stratix10`.  You cannot compile or execute programs on FPGA hardware on the `login` nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, increase the job timeout to 12h.

### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the Makefile by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the following command:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```
   
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the following command:
   
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/hostpipes.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

>*Note:* The Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 with Intel Stratix® 10 SX does not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.<br>

>**Tip**: If you encounter issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you might have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example `c:\samples\build`.  You can then run `cmake` from that directory, and provide `cmake` with the full path to your sample directory.

### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs]([https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide.html))

## Examining the Reports

Locate `report.html` in the `hostpipes_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in any of the following web browsers:  Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

Open the **Views** menu and select **System Viewer**.

In the left-hand pane, select **LoopBackKernelID** under the System hierarchy.

In the main **System Viewer** pane, the pipe read and pipe write for the kernel are highlighted. They show that the read is reading from the `cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype::internal::pipe<detail::HostPipePipeId<H2DPipeID>` host pipe, and that the write is writing to the `cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype::internal::pipe<detail::HostPipePipeId<D2HPipeID>` host pipe. Clicking on either of these host pipes verifies the width (32-bit corresponding to the `int` type) and depth (8, which is the `kPipeMinCapacity` that each pipe was declared with).

You might notice that there are additional identifiers in the pipe template (notably, `detail::HostPipePipeId`). This additional identifier is an internal implementation detail of this prototype feature. You can confirm the correspondence of these pipes to the ones declared in the source code by the template parameters `H2DPipeID` and `D2HPipeID`, which are the unique types declared in the source file and used in the pipe declarations:

```c++
// forward declare kernel and pipe names to reduce name mangling
...
class H2DPipeID;
class D2HPipeID;
...
using H2DPipe = cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype::pipe<
   // Usual pipe parameters
   H2DPipeID,         // An identified for the pipe
   ...
   >;
   
using D2HPipe = cl::sycl::ext::intel::prototype::pipe<
   // Usual pipe parameters
   D2HPipeID,         // An identified for the pipe
   ...
   >;     
```

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./hostpipes.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     hostpipes.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     ./hostpipes.fpga         (Linux)
     ```
