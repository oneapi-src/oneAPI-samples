## Purpose

This FPGA tutorial demonstrates an example of using the `mem_channel` buffer
property in conjuction with the `-Xsno-interleaving` flag to reduce the amount
of resources required to implement a DPC++ FPGA design.

By default, the Intel® oneAPI DPC++ compiler configures each global memory type
in a burst-interleaved manner where memory words are interleaved across the
available memory channels. This usually leads to better throughput because it
prevents load imbalance by ensuring that memory accesses do not favor one
external memory channel over another. Moreover, burst-interleaving enables you
to view a multi-channel memory as one large channel so you can write your code
without worrying about where each buffer should be allocated. However, this
configuration can be expensive in terms of FPGA resources because the global
memory interconnect required to orchestrate the memory accesses across all the
channels is complex. For more information about burst-interleaving, please
refer to the [oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Optimization
Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide).

The Intel® oneAPI DPC++ compiler allows you to avoid this area overhead by
disabling burst-interleaving and assigning buffers to individual channels. There
are two advantages to such configuration:
1. A simpler global memory interconnect is built, which requires a smaller
   amount of FPGA resources than the interconnect needed for the
   burst-interleaving configuration.
2. Potential improvements to the global memory bandwidth utilization due to
   less contention at each memory channel.

Burst-interleaving should only be disabled in situations where satisfactory
load balancing can be achived by assigning buffers to individual channels.
Otherwise, the global memory bandwidth utilization may be reduced, which will
negatively impact the throughput of your design.

To disable burst-interleaving, you need to pass the
`-Xsno-interleaving=<global_memory_type>` flag to your `dpcpp` command. The
global memory type is indicated in the board specification XML file for the
Board Support Package (BSP) that you're using. The board specification XML
file, called `board_spec.xml`, can be found in the root directory of your BSP.
For example, for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA BSP, the location
of this file is:
`$INTELFPGAOCLSDKROOT/board/intel_a10gx_pac/hardware/pac_a10/board_spec.xml`.
Note that this BSP only has a single memory type available as indicated in its
`board_spec.xml` file: `<global_mem name="DDR"`. The appropriate flag to pass
in this case is `-Xsno-interleaving=DDR`. Another option would be
`-Xsno-interleaving=default` since there is only one global memory type
available.

With interleaving disabled, you now have to specify, using the `mem_channel`
property, in which memory channel each buffer should be allocated:
```c++
buffer a_buf(a_vec, {property::buffer::mem_channel{1}});
buffer b_buf(b_vec, {property::buffer::mem_channel{2}});
```
Channel IDs are in the range `1,2,...,N` where `N` is the number of available
channels.

The `mem_channel` property has no effect if used without the
`-Xsno-interleaving` flag. In contrast, when `-Xsno-interleaving` is used,
buffers that don't have the `mem_channel` property will all be allocated in
channel `1`.

An important observation is that the `mem_channel` property is a runtime
specification which means you can change the selected channel ID for each
buffer without having to recompile the device code. In other words, when you
change the channel IDs, you only need to recompile the host code since
`mem_channel` has no impact on the RTL generated by the compiler. To learn how
to recompile the host code only and re-use an existing FPGA device image, please
refer to the FPGA tutorial "[Separating Host and Device Code Compilation](
https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/DPC%2B%2BFPGA/Tutorials/GettingStarted/fast_recompile)".

### Tutorial Design
The basic function performed by the tutorial kernel is an addition of 3
vectors. When burst-interleaving is disabled, each buffer is assigned to a
specific memory channel depending on how many channels are available.

Due to the nature of this design and the fact that all the buffers have the
same size, we expect accesses to the different memory channels to be well
balanced. Therefore, we can predict that disabling burst-interleaving will not
impact the throughput of the design, and so it is likely beneficial to disable
interleaving to avoid the area overhead imposed by the interleaving logic.

This tutorial requires compiling the source code twice: once with the
`-Xsno-interleaving` flag and once without it. In the `CMakeLists.txt` file,
the macro `NO_INTERLEAVING` is defined when the `-Xsno-interleaving` flag is
passed to the `dpcpp` command. The macro controls whether the buffers are
created with our without the `mem_channel` property.

To decide what channel IDs to select in the source code, the macros
`TWO_CHANNELS` and `FOUR_CHANNELS` are also used. The macro `TWO_CHANNELS` is
defined when the design is compiled for the Intel® PAC with Arria® 10 GX FPGA
because that board has an external memory with two available channels. In that
case, the 4 buffers are evenly assigned to the available channels on that
board. When the design is compiled for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 Stratix® 10 SX
FPGA, the 4 buffers are assigned to the 4 available channels on that board.
For other devices, please make sure to pass the correct macro (or create your
own) that clearly matches the number of channels available.

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at
`%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the
type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles
to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA
hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such
as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor
executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more
information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide
([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout
to 12h.

### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to
this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake`
   using the command:
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix®
   10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board
   support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the
   command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build
   targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete,
   FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be
   downloaded <a
   href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/mem_channel.fpga.tar.gz"
   download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake`
   using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix®
   10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board
   support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the
   command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build
   targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005
(with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA
hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package
(BSP) with Windows* support.<br>
*Note:* If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under
Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for
example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and
provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the
Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following
link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party
IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)


## Examining the Reports
Locate the pair of `report.html` files in the `mem_channel_interleaving.prj`
and `mem_channel_no_interleaving.prj` directories. Open the reports in any of
Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*. In the "Summary" tab, locate
the "Quartus Fitter Resource Utilization Summary" entry and expand it to see
the table showing the FPGA resources that were allocated for the design. Notice
that when burst-interleaving is disabled, the FPGA resources required are
significantly lower than the case where burst-interleaving is enabled.


## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./mem_channel.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     mem_channel.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
    Note that the `mem_channel` property and the `-Xsno-interleaving` flag have
    no impact on the emulator which is why we only have a single executable for
    this flow.
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device (two executables should be generated):
     ```
     ./mem_channel_interleaving.fpga         (Linux)
     ./mem_channel_no_interleaving.fpga      (Linux)
     ```

### Example of Output

Running `./mem_channel_interleaving.fpga`:
```
Vector size: 100000
Verification PASSED

Kernel execution time: 0.004004 seconds
Kernel throughput: 749.230914 MB/s
```

Running `./mem_channel_no_interleaving.fpga`:
```
Vector size: 100000
Verification PASSED

Kernel execution time: 0.003767 seconds
Kernel throughput without burst-interleaving: 796.379552 MB/s
```

### Discussion of Results

A test compile of this tutorial design achieved the following results on the
Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel® Arria® 10 GX FPGA. The table
below shows the performance of the design as well as the resources consumed by
the kernel system.
Configuration | Execution Time (ms) | Throughput (MB/s) | ALM | REG | MLAB | RAM | DSP
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
Without `-Xsno-interleaving` | 4.004 | 749.23 | 23,815.4 | 26,727  | 1094 | 53 | 0
With `-Xsno-interleaving` | 3.767 | 796.38 | 7,060.7  | 16,396  | 38 | 41  | 0

Similarly, when compiled for the Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with
Intel® Stratix® 10 SX FPGA, the tutorial design achieved the following results:
Configuration | Execution Time (ms) | Throughput (MB/s) | ALM | REG | MLAB | RAM | DSP
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
Without `-Xsno-interleaving` | 2.913  | 1029.90 | 14,999.6 | 47,532 | 11 | 345 | 0
With `-Xsno-interleaving` | 2.913 | 1029.77 | 9,564.1 | 28,616 | 11 | 186 | 0

Notice that the throughput of the design when burst-interleaving is disabled is
equal or better than when burst-interleaving is enabled. However, the resource
utilization is significantly lower without burst-interleaving. Therefore, this
is a design where disabling burst-interleaving and manually assigning buffers
to channels is a net win.
