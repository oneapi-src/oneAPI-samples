# Reducing latency of computations
This FPGA tutorial demonstrates how to use the `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute to reduce the area and latency of your FPGA kernels.  This attribute may reduce the FPGA FMax for your kernels.

***Documentation***:  The [DPC++ FPGA Code Samples Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/explore-dpcpp-through-intel-fpga-code-samples.html) helps you to navigate the samples and build your knowledge of DPC++ for FPGA. <br>
The [oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Optimization Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide) is the reference manual for targeting FPGAs through DPC++. <br>
The [oneAPI Programming Guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi-programming-guide) is a general resource for target-independent DPC++ programming.

## Purpose
The `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute enables you to direct the compiler to reduce the area and latency of your kernel.  Reducing the latency will not have a large effect on loops that are pipelined, unless the number of iterations of the loop is very small.
Computations in an FPGA kernel are normally grouped into *Stall Free Clusters*. This allows simplification of the signals within the cluster, but there is a FIFO queue at the end of the cluster that is used to save intermediate results if the computation needs to stall. *Stall Enable Clusters* save area and cycles by removing the FIFO queue and passing the stall signals to each part of the computation.  These extra signals may cause the FMax to be reduced

**NOTE**: If you specify `[[intel::use_stall_enable_clusters]]` on one or more kernels, this may reduce the FMax of the generated FPGA bitstream, which may reduce performance on all kernels.

**NOTE**: The `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute is not applicable for designs that target the Stratix® 10 architecture unless the `-Xshyper-optimized-handshaking=off` argument is passed to `dpcpp`
### Example: Using the `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute
```
h.single_task<class KernelComputeStallFree>( [=]() [[intel::use_stall_enable_clusters]] {
  // The computations in this device kernel will use Stall Enable clusters
  Work(accessor_vec_a, accessor_vec_b, accessor_res);
});
```
The FPGA compiler will use *Stall Enable Clusters* for the kernel when possible.  Some computations may not be stallable and need to be placed in a *Stall Free Cluster*.

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake ..
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), with hyper optimized handshaking disabled, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10 -DNO_HYPER_OPTIMIZATION=true
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization reports:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/stall_enable.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10 -DNO_HYPER_OPTIMIZATION=true
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.<br>
*Note:* If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

### Troubleshooting
If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `stall_enable_report.prj/reports/` and `stall_free_report.prj/reports/` directories. Open the reports in any of Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

On the main report page, scroll down to the section titled `Compile Estimated Kernel Resource Utilization Summary`. Note that the estimated number of **MLAB**s for KernelComputeStallEnable is smaller than that of KernelComputeStallFree. The reduction in MLABs is due to the elimination of the FIFO queue at the end of the cluster.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./stall_enable.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     stall_enable.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     ./stall_enable.fpga         (Linux)
     ./stall_free.fpga           (Linux)
     ```

### Example of Output

```
PASSED: The results are correct
```

### Discussion of Results
For this example, there should be no observable difference in results.  Only the area and latency differences are visible in the reports.
