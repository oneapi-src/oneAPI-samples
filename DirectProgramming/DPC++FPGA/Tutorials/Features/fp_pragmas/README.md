## Purpose
This tutorial demonstrates a simple example of using the `fp contract(fast|off)` and `fp reassociate(on|off)` pragmas.

### Description of the pragmas
The `fp contract(fast|off)` pragma controls whether the compiler can skip intermediate rounding and conversions mainly between double precision arithmetic operations. If multiple occurrences of this pragma affect the same scope of your code, the pragma with the narrowest scope takes precedence.

The `fp reassociate(on|off)` pragma controls the relaxing of the order of floating point arithmetic operations within the code block that this pragma is applied to. If multiple occurrences of this pragma affect the same scope of your code, the pragma with the narrowest scope takes precedence.

#### Example
This tutorial design applies `fp contract(off)` and `fp reassociate(off)` at a global scope.

A kernel in this tutorial applies `fp contract(fast)` to addition followed by multiplication. The following is an example:

```
#pragma clang fp contract(fast)
  double temp1 = 0.0, temp2 = 0.0;
  temp1 = accessorA[0] + accessorB[0];
  temp2 = accessorC[0] + accessorD[0];
  accessorRes[0] += temp1 * temp2;
```

A kernel in this tutorial applies `fp reassociate(on)` to a sequence of addition. The following is an example:

```
#pragma clang fp reassociate(on)
  accessorRes[0] += 
    accessorA[0] + accessorB[0] + accessorC[0] + accessorD[0];
```

## Key Concepts
* The basic usage of the `fp contract(fast|off)` and `fp reassociate(on|off)` pragmas
* How the `fp contract(fast|off)` and `fp reassociate(on|off)` pragmas affect resource use
* How to apply the `fp contract(fast|off)` and `fp reassociate(on|off)` pragmas in your program

## Building the `fp_pragmas` Tutorial

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (fpga_compile, fpga_runtime:arria10, or fpga_runtime:stratix10) and run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Install the design in `build` directory from the design directory by running `cmake`:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   If you are compiling for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design using the generated `Makefile`. The following four build targets are provided that match the recommended development flow:

   * Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulates an FPGA device) using:

     ```bash
     make fpga_emu
     ```

   * Generate HTML optimization reports using:

     ```bash
     make report
     ```

   * Compile and run on FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets an FPGA device) using:

     ```bash
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the FPGA hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/fp_pragmas.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * An FPGA hardware target is not provided on Windows*.

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Examining the Reports

Locate the pair of `report.html` files in either:

* **Report-only compile**:  `fp_pragmas_report.prj`
* **FPGA hardware compile**: `fp_pragmas.prj`

Open the reports in Google Chrome*, Mozilla Firefox*, Microsoft Edge*, or Microsoft Internet Explorer*.

On the main report page, scroll down to the section titled "Estimated Resource Usage". Each kernel name represents the pragma usage. e.g., `ContractFastKernel` sets the `fp contract(fast|off)` pragma to `fast` mode. You can verify that the number of ALMs used for kernels with `fp contract(fast)` or `fp reassociate(on)` is fewer than the kernels with `fp contract(off)` or `fp reassociate(off)` respectively.

## Running the Sample

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):

   ```bash
   ./fp_pragmas.fpga_emu    # Linux
   fp_pragmas.fpga_emu.exe  # Windows
   ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA device

   ```bash
   ./fp_pragmas.fpga             # Linux

### Example of Output

```txt
PASSED: The results are correct
```

### Discussion of Results

You can see the reduction of resource use in kernel ContractFastKernel comparing with ContractOffKernel. You will also note the decrease in resource use in kernel ReassociateOnKernel comparing with ReassociateOffKernel.
