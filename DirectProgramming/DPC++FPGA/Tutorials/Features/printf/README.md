## Purpose
This tutorial shows how to use some simple macros to enable easy use of the SYCL `printf()` function. This function allows printing from within code running on the FPGA.

### Motivation
Previously, we've provided examples for how to print data using the Stream class in the [FPGA Optimization Guide for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide/top/flags-attr-prag-ext/kernel-controls/pipes-extension/i-o-pipes.html).

Compare to the Stream class, `printf()` has the following advantages:

* `printf()` is a function that is globally available; Stream is an object which can only be obtained by passing it as a kernel argument from the host. In order to use Stream somewhere within your application, you have to pass the Stream object through the whole call stack. For debugging in large applications, using `printf()` has a great advantage allowing you to quickly add some print statements and easy to remove later without changing your main code.

* On the FPGA device, `printf()` has smaller area usage (less LSUs) and better performance (Stream could introduce massive II inner loops).

### Simple Code Example

Using `printf()` can be verbose in SYCL kernels. To simplify, add the following macro to your code.

```cpp
#ifdef __SYCL_DEVICE_ONLY__
  #define CL_CONSTANT __attribute__((opencl_constant))
#else
  #define CL_CONSTANT
#endif

#define PRINTF(format, ...) { \
            static const CL_CONSTANT char _format[] = format; \
            sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::printf(_format, ## __VA_ARGS__); }

PRINTF("Hello, World!\n");
PRINTF("Hello: %d\n", 123);
```

## Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel&reg; oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see the
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

## Building the `printf` Tutorial
> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
>
>For more information on environment variables, see **Use the setvars Script** for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in Intel&reg; DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel&reg; DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/printf.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> **Note**: The Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA and Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX) do not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.
[Learn more](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html).

 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide.html).

## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `printf_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

From the report, you can find the compilation information of the design and the estimated FPGA resource usage. For example, navigate to the Area Analysis section of the report (**Kernel System > BasicKernel > Computation**), and you can see the estimated resource usage (ALUTs, FFs, RAMs, etc.) for each `printf()` call.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./printf.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     printf.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     ./printf.fpga         (Linux)
     printf.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```

### Example of Output
```
Result1: Hello, World!
Result2: %
Result3: 123
Result4: 123
Result5: 1.00
Result6: print slash_n \n
Result7: Long: 650000
Result8: Preceding with blanks:       1977
Result9: Preceding with zeros: 0000001977
Result10: Some different radices: 100 64 144 0x64 0144
Result11: ABCD
```

## Known issues and limitations

There are some known issues with the `experimental::printf()` and that's why the function is in the experimental namespace. The following limitations exist when using `experimental::printf()` on FPGA hardware:

* Printing string literals %s is not supported yet. You can put the string directly in the format as a workaround. For example: `PRINTF("Hello, World!\n")`.
* Printing pointer address %p is not supported yet.
* If you have multiple PRINTF statements in the kernel, the order of printed data in the stdout might not obey the sequential order of those statements in the code.
* Buffer is only flushed to stdout after the kernel finishes in hardware.
