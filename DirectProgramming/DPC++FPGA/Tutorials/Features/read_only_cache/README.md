## Purpose

This FPGA tutorial demonstrates an example of using the read-only cache to
boost the throughput of an FPGA DPC++ design. Specifically, the read-only cache
is most appropriate for non-contiguous read accesses from off-chip memory
buffers that are guaranteed to be constant throughout the execution of a
kernel. The read-only cache is optimized for high cache hit performance.

To enable the read-only cache, the `-Xsread-only-cache-size<N>` flag should be
passed to the `dpcpp` command. Each kernel will get its own *private* version
of the cache that serves all reads in the kernel from read-only no-alias
accessors. Read-only no-alias accessors are accessors that have both the
`read_only` and the `no_alias` properties:
```c++
accessor sqrt_lut(sqrt_lut_buf, h, read_only, accessor_property_list{no_alias});
```
The `read_only` property is required because the cache is *read_only*. The
`no_alias` property is required to guarantee that the buffer will not be
written to from the kernel through another accessor or through a USM pointer.
You do not need to apply the `no_alias` property if the kernel already has the
`[[intel::kernel_args_restrict]]` attribute.

Each private cache is also replicated as many times as needed so that it can
expose extra read ports. The size of each replicate is `N` bytes as specified
by the `-Xsread-only-cache-size=<N>` flag.

### Tutorial Design
The basic function performed by the tutorial kernel is a series of table
lookups from a buffer (`sqrt_lut_buf`) that contains the square root values of
the first 512 integers. By default, the compiler will generate load-store units
(LSUs) that are optimized for the case where global memory accesses are
contiguous. When the memory accesses are non-contiguous, as is the case in this
tutorial design, these LSUs tend to suffer major throughput loss. The read-only
cache can sometimes help in such situations, especially when sized correctly.

This tutorial requires compiling the source code twice: once with the
`-Xsread-only-cache-size=<N>` flag and once without it. Because the look-up
table contains 512 integers as indicated by the `kLUTSize` constant, the chosen
size of the cache is `512*4 bytes = 2048 bytes`, and so, the flag
`-Xsread-only-cache-size=2048` is passed to `dpcpp`.

## Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

## Building the `read_only_cache` Tutorial
> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at
`%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the
type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles
to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA
hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such
as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor
executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more
information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide
([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout
to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake`
   using the command:
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix®
   10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board
   support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the
   command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build
   targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete,
   FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be
   downloaded <a
   href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/read_only_cache.fpga.tar.gz"
   download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake`
   using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix®
   10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board
   support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the
   command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build
   targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005
(with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA
hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package
(BSP) with Windows* support.<br>
*Note:* If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under
Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for
example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and
provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

### Troubleshooting
If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the
Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following
link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party
IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)


## Examining the Reports
Locate the pair of `report.html` files in the
`read_only_cache_disabled_report.prj` and `read_only_cache_enabled_report.prj`
directories. Open the reports in any of Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet
Explorer*. Navigate to the "Area Analysis of System" section of each report
(Area Analysis > Area Analysis of System) and expand the "Kernel System" entry
in the table. Notice that when the read-only cache is enabled, a new entry
shows up in the table called "Constant cache interconnect" indicating that the
cache has been created.


## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./read_only_cache.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     read_only_cache.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
    Note that the read-only cache is not implemented in emulation. The
    `-Xsread-only-cache-size<N>` flag does not impact the emulator in any way
    which is why we only have a single executable for this flow.
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device (two executables should be generated):
     ```
     ./read_only_cache_disabled.fpga         (Linux)
     ./read_only_cache_enabled.fpga          (Linux)
     ```

### Example of Output

Running `./read_only_cache_disabled.fpga`:
```

SQRT LUT size: 512
Number of outputs: 131072
Verification PASSED

Kernel execution time: 0.003377 seconds
Kernel throughput: 148.06 MB/s
```

Running `./read_only_cache_disabled.fpga`:
```

SQRT LUT size: 512
Number of outputs: 131072
Verification PASSED

Kernel execution time: 0.001675 seconds
Kernel throughput with the read-only cache: 298.51 MB/s
```

### Discussion of Results

A test compile of this tutorial design achieved the following results on the
Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel® Arria® 10 GX FPGA:

Configuration | Execution Time (ms) | Throughput (MB/s)
-|-|-
Without caching | 3.377 | 148.06
With caching | 1.675 | 298.51

When the read-only cache is enabled, performance notably increases. As
previously mentioned, when the global memory accesses are random (i.e.
non-contiguous), enabling the read-only cache and sizing it correctly may allow
the design to achieve a higher throughput.
