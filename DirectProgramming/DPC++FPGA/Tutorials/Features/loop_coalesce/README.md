# Coalescing Nested Loops
This FPGA tutorial demonstrates applying the `loop_coalesce` attribute to a nested loop in a task kernel to reduce the area overhead.

## Purpose
The `loop_coalesce` attribute enables you to direct the compiler to combine nested loops into a single loop. The attribute `[[intelfpga::loop_coalesce(N)]]` takes an integer argument `N`, that specifies how many nested loop levels that you want the compiler to attempt to coalesce.

**NOTE**: If you specify `[[intelfpga::loop_coalesce(1)]]` on nested loops, the compiler does not attempt to coalesce any of the nested loops.
### Example: Coalescing Two Loops 

```
[[intelfpga::loop_coalesce(2)]] 
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
  for (int j = 0; j < M; j++)
    sum[i][j] += i+j;  
```
The compiler coalesces the two loops together so that they execute as if they were a single loop written as follows:

```
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
while(i < N){
  sum[i][j] += i+j;
  j++;
  if (j == M){
    j = 0;
    i++;
  }
}
```

### Identifying Which Loops to Coalesce
Generally, coalescing loops can help reduce area usage by reducing the overhead needed for loop control. However, in some circumstances, coalescing loops can reduce kernel throughput. Scenarios where the `loop_coalesce` attribute can be applied to save area without a loss of throughput, are those where: 

   1. The loops being coalesced have the same initiation interval (II).
   2. The exit condition computation for the resulting coalesced look is not complicated.

If the innermost coalesced loop has a very small trip count, `loop_coalesce` might actually improve throughput.

## Building the `loop_coalesce` Tutorial

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     make report
     ``` 
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device): 
     ```
     make fpga
     ``` 
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/loop_coalesce.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     nmake report
     ``` 
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ``` 

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.
 
 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `loop_coalesce_report.prj/reports/` or `loop_coalesce_s10_pac_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in any of Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

On the main report page, scroll down to the section titled `Compile Estimated Kernel Resource Utilization Summary`. Each kernel name ends in the loop_coalesce attribute argument used for that kernel, e.g., KernelCompute<2> uses a loop_coalesce argument of 2. You can verify that the number of registers, MLABs and DSPs used for each kernel decreases after nested loops are coalesced.


## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./loop_coalesce.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     loop_coalesce.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     ./loop_coalesce.fpga         (Linux)
     ```

### Example of Output

```
Loop Coalesce: 1 -- kernel time : 156 microseconds
Throughput for kernel with coalesce_factor 1: 6550KB/S
Loop Coalesce: 2 -- kernel time : 113 microseconds
Throughput for kernel with coalesce_factor 2: 9064KB/S
PASSED: The results are correct

```

### Discussion of Results
The execution time and throughput for each kernel is displayed. Applying the `loop_coalesce` attribute in this example reduced the kernel execution time by a factor of ~1.5. Note that you will only see this result when executing on FPGA hardware. The emulator will generally not reflect performance differences.
