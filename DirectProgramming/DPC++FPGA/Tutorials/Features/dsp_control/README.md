## Purpose
This tutorial shows how to apply global and local controls to set the implementation preference between DSPs and soft-logic for certain math operations. The global control is applied using a command-line flag and affects applicable math operations in all kernels. The local control is applied as a library function and affects math operations in a block scope in a single kernel. Both global and local controls only affect math operations that support DSP control (see table below).

### Scope of Datatypes and math operations
| Datatype               | Controllable Math Operations
---                      |---
| `float`                | addition, subtraction, multiplication by a constant
| `ap_float<8, 23>`      | addition, subtraction, multiplication by a constant
| `int`                  | multiplication by a constant
| `ac_int`               | multiplication by a constant
| `ac_fixed`             | multiplication by a constant

### Global Control
The `-Xsdsp-mode=<option>` command-line flag sets implementation preference of math operations that support DSP control in all kernels. It has three valid options:
| Option               | Explanation
---                    |---
| `default`            | This is the default option if this command-line flag is not passed manually. The compiler determines the implementation based on datatype and math operation.
| `prefer-dsp`         | Prefer math operations to be implemented in **DSPs**. If a math operation is implemented by DSPs by default, you will see no difference in resource utilization or area. Otherwise, you will notice a decrease in the usage of soft-logic resources and an increase in the usage of DSPs.
| `prefer-softlogic`   | Prefer math operations to be implemented in **soft-logic**. If a math operation is implemented without DSPs by default, you will see no difference in resource utilization or area. Otherwise, you will notice a decrease in the usage of DSPs and an increase in the usage of soft-logic resources.

### Local Control
The library function `math_dsp_control<Preference::<enum>, Propagate::<enum>>([&]{})` provides block scope local control in one single kernel. A reference-capturing lambda expression is passed as the argument to this library function. Inside the lambda expression, implementation preference of math operations that support DSP control will be determined by two template arguments.

The first template argument `Preference::<option>` is an enum with three valid options:
| Option               | Explanation
---                    |---
| `DSP`                | Prefer math operations to be implemented in **DSPs**. Its behavior on a math operation is equivalent to global control `-Xsdsp-mode=prefer-dsp`. <br> **NOTE:** This option will be automatically applied if the template argument `Preference` is not specified manually.
| `Softlogic`          | Prefer math operations to be implemented in **soft-logic**. Its behavior on a math operation is equivalent to global control `-Xsdsp-mode=prefer-softlogic`.
| `Compiler_default`   | Compiler determines the implementation based on datatype and math operation. Its behavior on a math operation is equivalent to global control `-Xsdsp-mode=default`.

The second template argument `Propagate::<option>` is an enum that determines whether the DSP control applies to controllable math operations in function calls inside the lambda expression:
| Option  | Explanation
---       |---
| `On`    | DSP control recursively applies to controllable math operations in all function calls inside the lambda expression. <br> **NOTE:** This option will be automatically applied if the template argument `Propagate` is not specified manually.
| `Off`   | DSP control only applies to controllable math operations directly inside the lambda expression. Math operations in function calls inside the lambda expression are not affected by this DSP control.

**NOTE:**
1. A nested `math_dsp_control<>()` call is only controlled by its own `Preference`. The `Preference` of the parent `math_dsp_control<>()` does not affect the nested `math_dsp_control<>()`, even if the parent has `Propagate::On`.
2. Local control overrides global control on a controlled math operation.

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/dsp_control.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005
(with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware
on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with
Windows* support.<br> *Note:* If you encounter any issues with long paths when
compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a
shorter path, for example c:\samples\build. You can then run cmake from that
directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

### Troubleshooting
If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `dsp_control_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in any of Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

1. Navigate to Area Analysis of System (Area Analysis > Area Analysis of System). In this view, you can see usage of FPGA resources, which reflects the outcome of DSP control.
2. Navigate to System Viewer (Views > System Viewer). In this view, you can verify the `Implementation Preference` on the Details Panel of the graph node of a controlled math operation.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./dsp_control.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     dsp_control.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     ./dsp_control.fpga         (Linux)
     ```

### Example of Output
```
PASSED: all kernel results are correct.
```
