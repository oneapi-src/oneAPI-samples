_Notice: SYCL USM host allocations (and therefore this tutorial) are only supported for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX)_

## Purpose
The purpose of this tutorial is to show you how to take advantage of zero-copy host memory for the FPGA to improve the performance of your design. On FPGA, DPC++ implements all host and shared allocations as *zero-copy* data in host memory. This means that the FPGA will access the data directly over PCIe, which can improve performance in cases where there is little or no temporal reuse of data in the FPGA kernel. This tutorial includes two different kernels: one using traditional SYCL buffers (`src/buffer_kernel.hpp`) and one using USM host allocations (`src/restricted_usm_kernel.hpp`) that takes advantage of zero-copy host memory. Before completing this tutorial, it is suggested you review the **Explicit USM** (explicit_usm) tutorial.

### USM host allocations
Restricted USM allows the host and device to share their respective memories. A typical SYCL design, which transfers data using either SYCL buffers/accessors or USM device allocations, copies its input data from the Host Memory to the FPGA's Device Memory. To do this, the data is sent to the FPGA board over PCIe. Once all the data is copied to the FPGA's Device Memory, the FPGA kernel is run and produces output that is also stored in Device Memory. Finally, the output data is transferred from the FPGA's Device Memory back to the CPU's Host Memory over PCIe. This model is shown in the figure below.

```
|-------------|                                   |---------------|
|             |   |-------|   PCIe   |--------|   |               |
| Host Memory |<=>|  CPU  |<========>|  FPGA  |<=>| Device Memory |
|             |   |-------|          |--------|   |               |
|-------------|                                   |---------------|
```

Consider a kernel that simply performs computation for each entry in a buffer independently. Using SYCL buffers or explicit USM, we would bulk transfer the data from the Host Memory to the FPGA's Device Memory, run the kernel that performs the computation on each entry in the buffer, and then bulk transfer the buffer back to the host.

However, a better approach would simply stream the data from the host memory to the FPGA over PCIe, perform the computation on each piece of data, and then stream it back to host memory over PCIe. The desired structure is illustrated below. This would enable us to eliminate the overhead of copying the data to and from the Host Memory and the FPGA's Device Memory. This is done by using zero-copy host memory via the SYCL USM host allocations. This technique is demonstrated in `src/restricted_usm_kernel.hpp`.

```
|---------------|
|               |    |-------|  PCIe   |--------|
|               |    |       |========>|        |
|  Host Memory  |<==>|  CPU  |         |  FPGA  |
|               |    |       |<========|        |
|               |    |-------|  PCIe   |--------|
|---------------|
```

This approach is not considered host streaming since the CPU and FPGA cannot (reliably) access the input/output data simultaneously. In other words, the host must wait until all the FPGA kernels have finished before accessing the output data. However, we did avoid copying the data to and from the FPGA's Device Memory and therefore, we get overall savings in total latency. This savings can be seen by running the sample on FPGA hardware or the example output later in the [Example of Output](#example-of-output) section. Another FPGA tutorial, **Simple Host Streaming** (simple_host_streaming), describes how to achieve true host streaming using USM host allocations.

## Building the `zero_copy_data_transfer` Tutorial
### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.
 
### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).
 
When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.
 
### On a Linux* System
 
1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   To compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform with SYCL USM support. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:
 
   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
     ```
     make fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device): 
     ```
     make fpga
     ```

3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, an Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX) precompiled binary (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/zero_copy_data_transfer.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.
 
### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform with SYCL USM support. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     nmake report
     ``` 
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ``` 

*Note:* The Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) does not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.
