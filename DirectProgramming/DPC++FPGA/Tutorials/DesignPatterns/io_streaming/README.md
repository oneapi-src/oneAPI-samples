## Purpose
The purpose of this code sample is to demonstrate how to do trivial Input/Output (IO) streaming with DPC++ IO pipes. The following sections will describe IO streaming and IO pipes in more detail and will conclude with a description of the trivial design used to demonstrate these concepts and features.

### IO Streaming
In many of the other code samples designs, the FPGA device is treated as an accelerator, as illustrated in the figure below. The main computation (and therefore the data to be computed) resides on the host (i.e., the CPU) and we accelerate some compute intensive task using oneAPI kernels on the device. The host must move the data to the device, perform the calculation, and move the data back. Other code samples show how the FPGA can effectively offload compute intensive tasks from the CPU host.

However, a key feature of FPGAs is their rich input-output (IO) capabilities (e.g., Ethernet). Taking advantage of these capabilities within the oneAPI programming environment requires a different programming model than the accelerator model described in the previous section. In this model, which is illustrated in the figure below, we will create a oneAPI kernel (or kernels) where some of the kernels are connected to the FPGA's IO via IO pipes and the main data flow is *through* the FPGA device, rather than from CPU to FPGA and back.

There are 4 possible directions of data flow: IO-to-device, device-to-IO, device-to-host, and host-to-device. The direction and amount of data flowing in the system is application dependent. In this code sample, the main source of data is IO; data streams into the device from IO (IO-to-device) and out of the device to IO (device-to-IO). However, the host and device exchange low-bandwidth control signals using a host-to-device and device-to-host connection (or *side channel*).

### IO Pipes
IO-pipes have the same interface API as inter-kernel pipes (see the **Pipes** (pipes) code sample for more information). This abstraction is implemented in the Board Support Package (BSP) and provides a much simpler programming model for accessing the FPGAs IO. More information on the oneAPI IO pipe interface can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide/top/fpga-optimization-flags-attributes-pragmas-and-extensions/kernel-controls/pipes-extension/i-o-pipes.html).

For example, imagine that we want the oneAPI kernel to be able to receive UDP packets through the FPGA's Ethernet interface. Implementing the necessary hardware to process the data coming from the Ethernet pins in oneAPI would be both extremely difficult and inefficient. Moreover, there are already many RTL solutions for doing this. So instead we implement this low-level logic with RTL in the BSP. We expose this flow of data as a much simpler IO pipe interface to the processing kernels.

This example is illustrated in the figure below, where the BSP connects the Ethernet IO pins to a MAC IP, the MAC IP to a UDP offload engine IP, and finally the UDP offload engine IP to an IO pipe. This IO pipe can then be simply connected to the processing kernels. The details of these connections are abstracted from the oneAPI kernel developer. The figure below only shows an input IO pipe. The process is similar for an output IO pipe, but the data flows in the opposite direction.

### Faking IO Pipes
Unfortunately, designs that use these IO pipes are confined to BSPs that support that specific IO pipe, which makes prototyping and testing the processing kernels difficult. To address these concerns, we have created a library to _fake_ IO pipes. With this library, you can create kernels that behave like IO pipes without having a BSP that actually supports them. This allows you to start prototyping and testing your processing kernels without a BSP that supports IO pipes.

There are currently two options for faking IO pipes:
 * **Device memory allocations**: This option requires no special BSP support.
 * **Universal Shared Memory (USM) host allocations**: This option requires USM support in the BSP.

These options are illustrated in the figures below, respectively.

<img src="fake_io_pipe_ddr.png" alt="fake_io_pipe_ddr" width="600"/>
<img src="fake_io_pipe_usm.png" alt="fake_io_pipe_usm" width="600"/>

You can create _fake_ input data in either device or host memory. Then, the API kernel (`FakeIOPipeIn`) will read this data and produce it into a SYCL inter-kernel pipe (`IO Pipe In`). On the other end, an API kernel (`FakeIOPipeOut`) will read from an inter-kernel pipe (`IO Pipe Out`) and write to DDR or a USM host allocation so that you can analyze the output. In this tutorial, the `cmake` file (*src/CMakeLists.txt*) detects whether USM host allocations are supported and chooses to fake the streaming of data with DDR or USM host allocations automatically.

Since IO pipes and inter-kernel pipes have the same interface, the oneAPI kernels that implement the core algorithm are agnostic to whether they are reading from or writing to an IO pipe or a fake IO pipe. That is, the processing kernels will *always* stream data from `IO Pipe In` and to `IO Pipe Out`, which could be real or fake IO pipes. It is up to the system developer (i.e., the one connecting the oneAPI host and device) to instantiate the kernels and connect them to the correct pipes, which can be done easily using C++ templates and metaprogramming, as shown in *src/LoopbackTest.hpp* and *src/SideChannelTest.hpp* in this code sample. This allows the oneAPI kernel developer to prototype and test their kernel system without a BSP that supports IO pipes. Once the BSP is ready and available, swapping out the fake IO pipes for real IO pipes requires no changes to the processing kernels.

More information on IO pipes can be found [here](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide/top/fpga-optimization-flags-attributes-pragmas-and-extensions/kernel-controls/pipes-extension/i-o-pipes.html).

### Code Details
In this code sample, we demonstrate the concepts described in the previous section in a trivial way. The first test, in *src/LoopbackTest.hpp*, contains a simple loopback test that demonstrates how to use the fake IO pipes and steam data through a simple main processing kernel.

The second test, in *src/SideChannelTest.hpp* has a main processing kernel (`SideChannelMainKernel`) that constantly streams data in from the input IO pipe and streams the data out the output IO pipe. The main processing kernel sends an update to the host anytime it sees a value that matches a given value (`match_num`) through a device-to-host side channel (`MyDeviceToHostSideChannel`). The host can use a host-to-device side channel to update `match_num` as the kernel is processing without exiting and restarting the kernel (`MyHostToDeviceTermSideChannel`). The host also uses a host-to-device side channel to terminate the main processing kernel (`MyHostToDeviceSideChannel`). This is illustrated in the figure below.

<img src="tutorial_setup.png" alt="tutorial_setup" width="600"/>

Notice that the main kernel in the `SubmitSideChannelKernels` function in *src/SideChannelTest.cpp* is templated on the IO pipes and side channels. This means that the kernel developer of the main processing kernel does not care whether the IO pipes are real or fake. Using real or fake IO pipes is determined by the system developer when creating the full system, which is done in the `RunSideChannelsSystem` function in *src/SideChannelTest.hpp* and simply requires changing some template parameters.

## Building the `io_streaming` Code Sample

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     make report
     ```
