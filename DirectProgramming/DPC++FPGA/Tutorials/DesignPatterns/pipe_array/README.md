## Purpose
In certain situations, it is useful to create a collection of pipes that can be indexed like an array in a DPC++ FPGA design. If you are not yet familiar with DPC++ pipes, refer to the prerequisite tutorial "Data Transfers Using Pipes".

In SYCL*, each pipe defines a unique type with static methods for reading data (`read`) and writing data (`write`). Since pipes are not objects but *types*, defining a collection of pipes requires C++ template meta-programming. This is somewhat non-intuitive but yields highly efficient code.

This tutorial provides a convenient pair of header files defining an abstraction for an array of pipes. The headers can be used in any DPC++ design and can be extended as necessary.

### Example 1: A simple array of pipes

To create an array of pipes, include the top-level header (from this code sample) in your design:

```c++
#include "pipe_array.hpp"
```

As with regular pipes, an array of pipes needs template parameters for an ID, for the `min_capacity` of each pipe, and each pipe's data type. An array of pipes additionally requires one or more template parameters to specify the array size. The following code declares a one dimensional array of 10 pipes, each with `capacity=32`, that operate on `int` values.

```c++
using MyPipeArray = PipeArray<     // Defined in "pipe_array.h".
    class MyPipe,                  // An identifier for the pipe.
    int,                           // The type of data in the pipe.
    32,                            // The capacity of each pipe.
    10,                            // array dimension.
    >;
```

The uniqueness of a pipe array is derived from a combination of all template parameters.

Indexing inside a pipe array can be done via the `PipeArray::PipeAt` type alias, as shown in the following code snippet:

```c++
MyPipeArray::PipeAt<3>::write(17);
auto x = MyPipeArray::PipeAt<3>::read();
```
The template parameter `<3>` identifies a specific pipe within the array of pipes.  The index of the pipe being accessed *must* be determinable at compile time. 

In most cases, we want to use an array of pipes so that we can iterate over them in a loop. To respect the requirement that all pipe indices are uniquely determinable at compile time, we must use a static form of loop unrolling based on C++ templates. A simple example is shown in the code snippet:

```c++
// Write 17 to every pipe in the array
Unroller<0, 10>::Step([](auto i) {
  MyPipeArray::PipeAt<i>::write(17);
});
```
While this may initially feel foreign to those unaccustomed to C++ template metaprogramming, this is a simple and powerful pattern common to many C++ libraries. It is easy to reuse. In addition to `pipe_array.hpp`, this code sample includes a simple header file `unroller.hpp`, which implements the  `Unroller` functionality.

### Example 2: A 2D array of pipes

This code sample defines a `Producer` kernel that reads data from host memory and forwards this data into a two dimensional pipe matrix. 

The following code snippet creates a two dimensional pipe array.
``` c++
constexpr size_t kNumRows = 2;
constexpr size_t kNumCols = 2;
constexpr size_t kDepth = 2;

using ProducerToConsumerPipeMatrix = PipeArray<  // Defined in "pipe_array.h".
    class ProducerConsumerPipe,                  // An identifier for the pipe.
    uint64_t,                                    // The type of data in the pipe.
    kDepth,                                      // The capacity of each pipe.
    kNumRows,                                    // array dimension.
    kNumCols                                     // array dimension.
    >;
```
The producer kernel writes `num_passes` units of data into each of the `kNumRows * kNumCols` pipes. Note that the unrollers' lambdas must capture certain variables from their outer scope.

```c++
h.single_task<ProducerTutorial>([=]() {
  size_t input_idx = 0;
  for (size_t pass = 0; pass < num_passes; pass++) {
    // Template-based unroll (outer "i" loop)
    Unroller<0, kNumRows>::Step([&input_idx, input_accessor](auto i) {
      // Template-based unroll (inner "j" loop)
      Unroller<0, kNumCols>::Step([&input_idx, i, input_accessor](auto j) {
        // Write a value to the <i,j> pipe of the pipe array
        ProducerToConsumerPipeMatrix::PipeAt<i, j>::write(
            input_accessor[input_idx++]);
      });
    });
  }
});
```

The code sample also defines an array of `Consumer` kernels that each read from a unique pipe in `ProducerToConsumerPipeMatrix`, process the data, and write the result to the host memory. 

```c++
// The consumer kernel reads from a single pipe, determined by consumer_id
h.single_task<ConsumerTutorial<consumer_id>>([=]() {
  constexpr size_t x = consumer_id / kNumCols;
  constexpr size_t y = consumer_id % kNumCols;
  for (size_t i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i) {
    auto input = ProducerToConsumerPipeMatrix::PipeAt<x,y>::read();
    uint64_t answer = ConsumerWork(input); // do some processing
    output_accessor[i] = answer;
  }
});
```

The host must thus enqueue the producer kernel and `kNumRows * kNumCols` separate consumer kernels. The latter is achieved through another static unroll.
```c++
{
  queue q(device_selector, dpc_common::exception_handler);

  // Enqueue producer
  buffer<uint64_t,1> producer_buffer(producer_input);
  Producer(q, producer_buffer);
  
  // Use template-based unroll to enqueue multiple consumers    
  std::vector<buffer<uint64_t,1>> consumer_buffers;
  Unroller<0, kNumberOfConsumers>::Step([&](auto consumer_id) {
    consumer_buffers.emplace_back(consumer_output[consumer_id].data(), items_per_consumer);
    Consumer<consumer_id>(q, consumer_buffers.back());
  });
}
```

## Building the `pipe_array` Tutorial

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     make report
     ``` 
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device): 
     ```
     make fpga
     ``` 
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/pipe_array.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     nmake report
     ``` 
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ``` 

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.
 
 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)


## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `pipe_array_report.prj/reports/` or `pipe_array_s10_pac_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in any of Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

You can visualize the kernels and pipes generated by looking at the "System Viewer" section of the report. However, it is recommended that you first reduce the array dimensions `kNumRows` and `kNumCols` to small values (2 or 3) to facilitate visualization.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./pipe_array.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     pipe_array.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     ./pipe_array.fpga         (Linux)
     ```
