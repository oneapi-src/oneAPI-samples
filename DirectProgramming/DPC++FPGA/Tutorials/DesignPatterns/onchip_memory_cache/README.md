## Purpose
In SYCL* task kernels for FPGA, our objective is to achieve an initiation interval (II) of 1 on performance-critical loops. This means that a new loop iteration is launched on every clock cycle, maximizing the loop's throughput.

When the loop contains a loop-carried variable implemented in on-chip memory, the compiler often *cannot* achieve II=1 because the memory access takes more than one clock cycle. If the updated memory location may be needed on the next loop iteration, the next iteration must be delayed to allow time for the update, hence II > 1.

The technique of using the `OnchipMemoryWithCache` class breaks this dependency by storing recently-accessed values in a cache capable of a 1-cycle read-modify-write operation. The cache is implemented in FPGA registers rather than on-chip memory. By pulling memory accesses preferentially from the register cache, the loop-carried dependency is broken.

### When is the on-chip memory with cache technique applicable?

***Failure to achieve II=1 because of a loop-carried memory dependency in on-chip memory***:
The on-chip memory with cache technique is applicable if the compiler could not pipeline a loop with II=1 because of an on-chip memory dependency. (If the compiler could not achieve II=1 because of a *global* memory dependency, this technique does not apply as the access latencies are too great.)

To check this for a given design, view the "Loops Analysis" section of its optimization report. The report lists the II of all loops and explains why a lower II is not achievable. Check whether the reason given resembles "the compiler failed to schedule this loop with smaller II due to memory dependency". The report will describe the "most critical loop feedback path during scheduling". Check whether this includes on-chip memory load/store operations on the critical path.

***An II=1 loop with a load operation of latency 1***:
The compiler is capable of reducing the latency of on-chip memory accesses to achieve II=1. In doing so, the compiler makes a trade-off by sacrificing f<sub>MAX</sub> to improve the II.

In a design with II=1 critical loops but lower than desired f<sub>MAX</sub>, the on-chip memory with cache technique may still be applicable. It can help recover f<sub>MAX</sub> by enabling the compiler to achieve II=1 with a higher latency memory access.

To check whether this is the case for a given design, view the "Kernel Memory Viewer" section of the optimization report. Select the on-chip memory of interest from the Kernel Memory List, and mouse over the load operation "LD" to check its latency. If the latency of the load operation is 1, this is a clear sign that the compiler has attempted to sacrifice f<sub>MAX</sub> to improve loop II.


### Implementing the on-chip memory with cache technique

The tutorial demonstrates the technique using a program that computes a histogram. The histogram operation accepts an input vector of values, separates the values into groups, and counts the number of values per group. For each input value, an output group is determined, and the count for that group is incremented. This count is stored in the on-chip memory, and the increment operation requires reading from memory, performing the increment, and storing the result. This read-modify-write operation is the critical path that can result in II > 1.

To reduce II, the idea is to store recently-accessed values in an FPGA register-implemented cache that is capable of a 1-cycle read-modify-write operation. If the memory location required on a given iteration exists in the cache, it is pulled from there. The updated count is written back to the cache. The cache is implemented as a shift register which stores the N most recent writes.  As a value exits the end of the shift register, it is written into the on-chip memory. The implementation of the cache is hidden away inside the OnchipMemoryWithCache class, which users may reuse in their own applications.

### Selecting the cache depth

While any value of `CACHE_DEPTH` results in functional hardware, the ideal value of `CACHE_DEPTH` requires some experimentation. The depth of the cache needs to roughly cover the latency of the on-chip memory access. To determine the correct value, it is suggested to start with a value of 1 and then increase it until both II = 1 and load latency > 1. In this tutorial, a `CACHE_DEPTH` of 7 is needed to achieve this goal.

For user designs, each iteration takes only a few moments to compile the reports. It is important to find the *minimal* value of `CACHE_DEPTH` that results in a maximal performance increase. Unnecessarily large values of `CACHE_DEPTH` consume unnecessary FPGA resources and can reduce f<sub>MAX</sub>. Therefore, at a `CACHE_DEPTH` that results in II=1 and load latency = 1, if further increases to `CACHE_DEPTH` show no improvement, `CACHE_DEPTH` should not be increased any further.

This tutorial creates multiple kernels sweeping across different cache depths within a single design.  This allows a single compile of the reports to determine the optimal cache depth.

The included headers `onchip_memory_with_cache.hpp` and `unrolled_loop.hpp` are located in the same Code Samples GIT repo as this tutorial.

### Running Samples in Intel&reg; DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel&reg; DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see the 
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

> **Note**: The Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA and Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX) do not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide.html)


## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `onchip_memory_cache_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in any of Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

Compare the Loop Analysis reports for kernels with various cache depths, as described in the "When is the on-chip memory cache technique applicable?" section.  This will illustrate that any cache depth > 0 allows a loop II of 1.

Open the Kernel Memory viewer and compare the Load Latency on the loads from kernels with various cache depths, as describe in the "When is the on-chip memory cache technique applicable?" section. This will illustrate that a cache depth of at least 7 is required to achieve a load latency of > 1.


## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./onchip_memory_cache.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     onchip_memory_cache.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device:
     ```
     ./onchip_memory_cache.fpga_sim         (Linux)
     onchip_memory_cache.fpga_sim.exe       (Windows)
     ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     ./onchip_memory_cache.fpga         (Linux)
     onchip_memory_cache.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```

### Discussion of Results

As the sample results above demonstrate, adding the cache to achieve an II of 1 approximately doubles the throughput of the kernel.

Because the f<sub>MAX</sub> of a design is determined by the slowest kernel, we are not able to see the f<sub>MAX</sub> improvement of increasing the load latency from 1 to 4. To see that, you would have to compile the design with a single kernel at a time.

When caching is used, performance noticeably increases. As previously mentioned, this technique should result in an II reduction, which should lead to a throughput improvement. The technique can also improve f<sub>MAX</sub> if the compiler had previously implemented a latency=1 load operation, in which case the f<sub>MAX</sub> increase should result in a further throughput improvement.
