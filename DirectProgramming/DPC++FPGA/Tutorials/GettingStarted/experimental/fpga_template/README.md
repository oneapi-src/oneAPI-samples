***Notice**: SYCL Unified Shared Memory (USM) host allocations (and therefore the code in this tutorial) are only supported by Board Support Packages (BSPs) with USM support (e.g. the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) `intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10_usm`)* 

## Purpose

Use this project as a starting point when you build designs for the Intel® oneAPI FPGA compiler. It includes a CMake build system to automate selecting the various command-line flags for the oneAPI FPGA compiler, and a simple single-source design to serve as an example. You can customize the build flags by modifying the top part of `src/CMakeLists.txt`: if you want to pass additional flags to the Intel® oneAPI FPGA compiler, you can change the `USER_FLAGS` and `USER_HARDWARE_FLAGS` variables defined in `src/CMakeLists.txt`. 

> **Note**: The code sample in this design only uses USM for improved code simplicity as compared with buffers/accessors. The included CMake build system can also be used for designs that do not use USM.

| Variable              | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
|:---                   |:---
| `USER_HARDWARE_FLAGS` | These flags apply only to flows that generate FPGA hardware (i.e. report, simulation, hardware). You can specify flags such as `-Xsclock` or `-Xshyper-optimized-handshaking=off` |
| `USER_FLAGS`          | These flags apply to all flows, including emulation. You can specify flags such as `-v` or define macros such as `-DYOUR_OWN_MACRO=3`                                             |

# Use cmake -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> to choose a

# exhaustive):
#   intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
#   intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10_usm
#   intel_a10gx_pac:pac_a10
# Note that depending on your installation, you may need to specify the full 
# path to the board support package (BSP), this usually is in your install 
# folder.
#
# You can also specify a device family (E.g. "Arria10" or "Stratix10") or a
# specific part number (E.g. "10AS066N3F40E2SG") to generate a standalone IP.
if(NOT DEFINED FPGA_DEVICE)
    set(FPGA_DEVICE "intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10_usm")
endif()

# Use cmake -DUSER_HARDWARE_FLAGS=<flags> to set extra flags for FPGA backend
# compilation. 
set(USER_HARDWARE_FLAGS "${USER_HARDWARE_FLAGS}")

# Use cmake -DUSER_FLAGS=<flags> to set extra flags for general compilation.
set(USER_FLAGS "${USER_FLAGS}")
```

Everything below this in the `src/CMakeLists.txt` is necessary for selecting the compiler flags that are necessary to support the build targets specified below, and should not need to be modified.

### Running Samples in Intel® DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).
When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.
### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)
You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.
The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.
To learn more about the extensions, see the
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

Use these commands to run the design, depending on your OS.

### On a Linux* System 
This design uses CMake to generate a build script for GNU/make.

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   To compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```

   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

   > **NOTE**: This design will **not** work on the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, because the design depends on USM.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   | Target          | Expected Time  | Output                                                                       | Description
   |:---             |:---            |:---                                                                          |:---
   | `make fpga_emu` | Seconds        | x86-64 binary                                                                | Compiles the FPGA device code to the CPU. Use the Intel® FPGA Emulation Platform for OpenCL™ software to verify your SYCL code’s functional correctness.
   | `make report`   | Minutes        | RTL + FPGA reports                                                           | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and generates an optimization report that describes the structures generated on the FPGA, identifies performance bottlenecks, and estimates resource utilization. This report will include the interfaces defined in your selected Board Support Package.
   | `make fpga_sim` | Minutes        | RTL + FPGA reports + x86-64 binary                                           | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and generates a simulation testbench. Use the Questa*-Intel® FPGA Edition simulator to verify your design.
   | `make fpga`     | Multiple Hours | Quartus Place & Route (Full accelerator) + FPGA reports + x86-64 host binary | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and generate an FPGA image that you can run on a supported accelerator board.

   The `fpga_emu`, `fpga_sim` and `fpga` targets produce binaries that you can run. The executables will be called `TARGET_NAME.fpga_emu`, `TARGET_NAME.fpga_sim`, and `TARGET_NAME.fpga`, where `TARGET_NAME` is the value you specify in `src/CMakeLists.txt`.

### On a Windows* System
This design uses CMake to generate a build script for  `nmake`.

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   To compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```bash
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```

   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

   > **NOTE**: This design will **not** work on the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, because the design depends on USM.


2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   | Target           | Expected Time  | Output                                                                       | Description
   |:---              |:---            |:---                                                                          |:---
   | `nmake fpga_emu` | Seconds        | x86-64 binary                                                                | Compiles the FPGA device code to the CPU. Use the Intel® FPGA Emulation Platform for OpenCL™ software to verify your SYCL code’s functional correctness.
   | `nmake report`   | Minutes        | RTL + FPGA reports                                                           | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and generates an optimization report that describes the structures generated on the FPGA, identifies performance bottlenecks, and estimates resource utilization. This report will include the interfaces defined in your selected Board Support Package.
   | `nmake fpga_sim` | Minutes        | RTL + FPGA reports + x86-64 binary                                           | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and generates a simulation testbench. Use the Questa*-Intel® FPGA Edition simulator to verify your design.
   | `nmake fpga`     | Multiple Hours | Quartus Place & Route (Full accelerator) + FPGA reports + x86-64 host binary | Compiles the FPGA device code to RTL and generate an FPGA image that you can run on a supported accelerator board.

   The `fpga_emu`, `fpga_sim`, and `fpga` targets also produce binaries that you can run. The executables will be called `TARGET_NAME.fpga_emu.exe`, `TARGET_NAME.fpga_sim.exe`, and `TARGET_NAME.fpga.exe`, where `TARGET_NAME` is the value you specify in `src/CMakeLists.txt`.

   > **Note**: The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

   > **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.
