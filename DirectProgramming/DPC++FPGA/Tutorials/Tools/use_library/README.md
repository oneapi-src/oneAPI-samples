## Purpose

This FPGA tutorial demonstrates how to build SYCL device libraries from RTL sources and use them in your SYCL design. An RTL library is useful for embedding high performance FPGA code, handwritten in Verilog into your oneAPI program.

### Generating a library

To create a library from  source code, use the following steps:

1. `fpga_crossgen` creates object file that contains representations for target devices (FPGA) and FPGA emulator. The following command instructs `fpga_crossgen` to generate SYCL target objects from an RTL source in this tutorial:

   ```bash
   # Linux
   fpga_crossgen lib_rtl_spec.xml --emulation_model lib_rtl_model.cpp --target sycl -o lib_rtl.o

   # Windows
   fpga_crossgen lib_rtl_spec.xml --emulation_model lib_rtl_model.cpp --target sycl -o lib_rtl.obj
   ```

   Note that generating an RTL library requires that an `xml` file and a C++ emulation model be provided in addition to the Verilog source code. The RTL is used when compiling for the hardware whereas the emulation model is used when the oneAPI program is run on the FPGA emulator. Examine the tutorial source code and the comments in `use_library.cpp` for more details.

2. `fpga_libtool` collects one or more objects into a SYCL library archive file. This command creates a single library archive file from one or more object files generated by `fpga_crossgen` in the previous step:

   ```bash
   # Linux
   fpga_libtool lib_rtl.o --target sycl --create lib.a

   # Windows
   fpga_libtool lib_rtl.obj --target sycl --create lib.lib

   ```

### Using the library

To use the generated library in your project, simply add the generated library archive file to the list of input source files when invoking `icpx`. To compile the `use_library` tutorial, pass both `use_library.cpp` and `lib.a` as inputs.

```bash
# Compile for FPGA emulator
icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga use_library.cpp lib.a -o use_library_emu.fpga -DFPGA_EMULATOR

# Compile for FPGA Simulator
icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga use_library.cpp lib.a -o use_library.fpga -Xssimulation -DFPGA_SIMULATOR

# Compile for FPGA hardware
icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga use_library.cpp lib.a -o use_library.fpga -Xshardware
```

## Building the `use_library` Tutorial

### Running Samples in DevCloud

If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 12h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```bash
    cmake ..
   ```

   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:

   ```bash
   cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

      ```bash
      make fpga_emu
      ```

   * Generate the optimization report:

     ```bash
     make report
     ```

   * Compile for FPGA Simulator

     ```bash
     make fpga_sim
     ```

   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```bash
     make fpga
     ```

3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/use_library.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   To compile for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```

   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   - Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```

   - Generate the optimization report:

     ```
     nmake report
     ```

   - Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced problem size):

     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```

   - Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Running the Sample

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):

     ```bash
     ./use_library.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     use_library.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device

     ```bash
     ./use_library.fpga_sim     (Linux)
     use_library.fpga_sim.exe   (Windows)
     ```

3. Run the sample on the FPGA device:

     ```bash
     ./use_library.fpga         (Linux)
     use_library.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```
