## Purpose

This DPC++ reference design implements a compression algorithm. The implementation is optimized for the FPGA device. The compression result is GZIP-compatible and can be decompressed with GUNZIP. The GZIP output file format is compatible with GZIP's DEFLATE algorithm, and follows a fixed subset of [RFC 1951](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1951.txt). See the References section for more specific references. 

The algorithm uses a GZIP-compatible Limpel-Ziv 77 (LZ77) algorithm for data de-duplication, and a GZIP-compatible Static Huffman algorithm for bit reduction. The implementation includes three FPGA accelerated tasks (LZ77, Static Huffman and CRC). 

The FPGA implementation of the algorithm enables either one or two independent GZIP compute engines to operate in parallel on the FPGA. The number of engines is constrained by the available FPGA resources. By default, the design is parameterized to create a single engine when the design is compiled targeting Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA. Two engines are created when targeting Intel® PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA), a larger device.

This reference design contains 2 variants: "High Bandwidth" and "Low-Latency".
The High Bandwidth variant maximizes system throughput without regard for latency. It transfers input/output SYCL Buffers to FPGA-attached DDR. The kernel then operates on these buffers.
The Low-Latency variant takes advantage of Universal Shared Memory (USM) to avoid these copy operations, allowing the GZIP engine to directly access input/output buffers in host-memory. This reduces latency but throughput is also reduced. "Latency" in this context is defined as the duration of time between when the input buffer is available in host memory to when the output buffer (i.e. the compressed result) is available in host memory.
 
## Key Implementation Details

 | Kernel                     | Description
---                          |---
| LZ Reduction               | Implements a LZ77 algorithm for data de-duplication. The algorithm produces distance and length information that is compatible with GZIP's DEFLATE implementation. 
| Static Huffman             | Uses the same Static Huffman codes used by GZIP's DEFLATE algorithm when it chooses a Static Huffman coding scheme for bit reduction. This choice maintains compatibility with GUNZIP. 
| CRC                        | Adds a CRC checksum based on the input file; this is required by the gzip file format 

To optimize performance, GZIP leverages techniques discussed in the following FPGA tutorials: 
* **Double Buffering to Overlap Kernel Execution with Buffer Transfers and Host Processing** (double_buffering)
* **On-Chip Memory Attributes** (mem_config)

## Building the `gzip` Reference Design
 
### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.
 
### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (fpga_compile or fpga_runtime) as well as whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)).
 
When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 24h.
 
### On a Linux* System
 
1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA), run `cmake` using the command:
 
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10_usm
   ```
2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:
 
   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
    > Note: for the Low Latency variant use `make fpga_emu_ll`

   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     make report
     ``` 
    > Note: for the Low Latency variant use `make report_ll`

   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device): 
     ```
     make fpga
     ``` 
    > Note: for the Low Latency variant use `make fpga_ll`
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/gzip.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.
 
### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10_usm
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
    > Note: for the Low Latency variant use `nmake fpga_emu_ll`     
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     nmake report
     ``` 
    > Note: for the Low Latency variant use `nmake report_ll`          
   * An FPGA hardware target is not provided on Windows*. 

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.
 
 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
 
You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)
 
 
## Running the Reference Design
 
 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./gzip.fpga_emu <input_file> [-o=<output_file>]     (Linux)
     gzip.fpga_emu.exe <input_file> [-o=<output_file>]   (Windows)
     ```
    > Note: for the Low Latency variant use `gzip.fpga_emu_ll`     
2. Run the sample on the FPGA device:
     ```
     aocl initialize acl0 pac_s10_usm
     ./gzip.fpga <input_file> [-o=<output_file>]         (Linux)
     ```
     > Note: for the Low Latency variant use `gzip.fpga_ll`     
 ### Application Parameters

| Argument | Description
---        |---
| `<input_file>` | Mandatory argument that specifies the file to be compressed. Use a 120+ MB file to achieve peak performance (80kB for Low Latency variant).
| `-o=<output_file>` | Optional argument that specifies the name of the output file. The default name of the output file is `<input_file>.gz`. When targeting Intel® PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA), the single `<input_file>` is fed to both engines, yielding two identical output files, using `<output_file>` as the basis for the filenames.
 
### Example of Output
 
```
Running on device:  pac_a10 : Intel PAC Platform (pac_ee00000)
Throughput: 3.4321 GB/s
Compression Ratio 33.2737%
PASSED
```
