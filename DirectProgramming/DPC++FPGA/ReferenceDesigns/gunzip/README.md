## License  
Code samples are licensed under the MIT license. See
[License.txt](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/blob/master/License.txt) for details.

## Building the Reference Design

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Code Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 24h.
 
### On a Linux* System
1. Install the design into a directory `build` from the design directory by running `cmake`:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   If you are compiling for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   If instead you are compiling for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following targets are provided, and they match the recommended development flow:

    * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga_emu
       ```

    * Generate HTML performance report. Find the report in `gunzip_report.prj/reports/report.html`directory.

       ```
       make report
       ```

    * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga
       ```

3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/gunzip.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System
1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:
   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     nmake report
     ``` 
   * An FPGA hardware target is not provided on Windows*. 

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this Reference Design in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Running the Reference Design

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
     ```
     ./gunzip.fpga_emu    (Linux)
     gunzip.fpga_emu.exe  (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA device.
     ```
     ./gunzip.fpga        (Linux)
     ```

### Example of Output
You should see output similar to the following in the console:
```
TODO
```
NOTE: When running on the FPGA emulator, the *Execution time* and *Throughput* do not reflect the design's actual hardware performance.
