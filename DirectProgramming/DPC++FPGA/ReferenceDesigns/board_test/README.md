## Key Implementation Details

A oneAPI Board Support Package (BSP) consists of software layers and an FPGA hardware scaffold design, making it possible to target an FPGA through the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.

The compiler stitches the generated FPGA design into the oneAPI BSP framework. Refer to the [Intel® oneAPI Programming Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/programming-interface/fpga-flow/fpga-bsps-and-boards.html) for information about oneAPI BSPs.

The BSP hardware components typically comprise RTL for all interfaces the oneAPI kernel requires; for example, a PCIe IP for the host to kernel communication, EMIF (External Memory Interface) IP for kernel to memory, and host to FPGA board memory communication among other things.

The BSP software components typically consist of a Memory Mapped Device (MMD) layer and a driver. The implementation is vendor-dependent.

The BSP consists of components operating at different clock domains. PCIe and external memories operate at a fixed frequency. Corresponding RTL IPs are parametrized to operate at these fixed frequencies by platform vendors. The kernel clock frequency varies and is calculated as part of the oneAPI offline compilation flow for FPGAs. The BSP has logic to handle the data transfer across these clock domains.

`Board Test` measures the frequency that the kernel is running at in the FPGA and compares this to the compiled kernel clock frequency.

The following block diagram shows an overview of a typical oneAPI FPGA BSP hardware design and the numbered arrows depict the following:

- Path 1 represents the host-to-device global memory interface.
- Path 2 represents the host to kernel interface.
- Path 3 represents the kernel-to-device global memory interface.

### Source Code Explanation

| File               | Description
|:---                |:---
| `board_test.cpp`   | Contains the `main()` function and the test selection logic as well as calls to each test.
| `board_test.hpp`   | Contains the definitions for all the individual tests in the sample.
| `host_speed.hpp`   | Header for host speed test. Contains definition of functions used in host speed test.
| `helper.hpp`       | Contains constants (for example, binary name) used throughout the code as well as definition of functions that print help and measure execution time.

### Compiler Flags Used

| Flag                  | Description
|:---                   |:---
`-Xsno-interleaving`    | By default oneAPI compiler burst interleaves across same memory type.  `-Xsno-interleaving` disables burst interleaving and enables testing each memory bank independently. (See the [FPGA Optimization Guide for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits Developer Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide/top/flags-attr-prag-ext/optimization-flags/disabl-burst-int.html) for more information.)

## Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

## Build the `Board Test` Program

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 1. Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 2. Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 3. Open a terminal in VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**).
 4. Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see the 
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for **Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX)**, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   For **Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA**, enter the following:
   ```
   cmake -DFPGA_DEVICE=intel_a10gx_pac:pac_a10 ..
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system, and enter a command similar to the following example:
   ```
   cmake -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> ..
   ```
3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate HTML performance report.
      ```
      make report
      ```
      The report resides at `board_test.prj/reports/report.html`.

   3. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga
      ```

   (Optional) The hardware compiles listed above can take several hours to complete; alternatively, you can download FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) from [https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/board_test.fpga.tar.gz](https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/board_test.fpga.tar.gz).

### On Windows*

>**Note**: The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for **Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX)**, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   To compile for the **Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA**, enter the following:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DFPGA_DEVICE=intel_a10gx_pac:pac_a10 ..
   ```
   You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system, and enter a command similar to the following example:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> ..
   ```
3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate HTML performance report.
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
      The report resides at `board_test_report.prj/reports/report.html`.

   3. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```
>**Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example `C:\samples\build`. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

#### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the [Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html) for more information on using the utility.


## Run the `Board Test` Program

The `Board Test` program checks following interfaces in a platform:

- **Host-to-device global memory interface:** This interface is checked by performing explicit data movement between the host and device global memory. Host to device global memory bandwidth is measured and reported. As a part of this interface check, unaligned data transfers are also performed to verify that non-DMA transfers complete successfully.

- **Kernel-to-device global memory interface:** This interface is checked by performing kernel to memory data transfers using simple read and write kernels. Kernel to memory bandwidth is measured and reported.

  > **Note**: This test currently does not support SYCL Unified Shared Memory (USM). For testing the USM interface, use the [Simple host streaming sample](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/DirectProgramming/DPC%2B%2BFPGA/Tutorials/DesignPatterns/simple_host_streaming) code sample in the oneAPI-sample GitHub repository.

- **Host-to-kernel interface:** The test ensures that the host to kernel communication is correct and that the host can launch a kernel successfully. It also measures the roundtrip kernel launch latency and throughput (number of kernels/ms) of single task no-operation kernels.

- **Kernel clock frequency:** The test measures the frequency the programmed kernel is running at on the FPGA device and reports it. By default, this test fails if the measured frequency is not within 2% of the compiled frequency.

  >**Note**: Kernel clock frequency test measures the frequency that the programmed kernel is running at on the FPGA device and reports it. By default, this test fails if the measured frequency is not within 2% of the compiled frequency. The test allows overriding this failure; however, overriding might lead to functional errors, and it is not recommended. The override option is provided to allow debug in case where platform design changes are done to force kernel to run at slower clock (this is not a common use-case). To override, set the `report_chk` variable to `false` in `board_test.cpp` and recompile only the host code by using the `-reuse-exe=board_test.fpga` option in your compile command.


### Configurable Parameters

The complete board test is divided into six subtests. By default, all tests run. You can choose to run a single test by using the `-test=<test number>` option. Refer to the [Running the Sample](#running-the-sample) section for test usage instructions.

| Test Number  | Test Name
|:---          |:---
| 1            | Host Speed and Host Read Write Test
| 2            | Kernel Clock Frequency Test
| 3            | Kernel Launch Test
| 4            | Kernel Latency Measurement
| 5            | Kernel-to-Memory Read Write Test
| 6            | Kernel-to-Memory Bandwidth Test

>**Note:** You should run all tests at least once to ensure that the platform interfaces are fully functional.

To view test details and usage information using the binary, use the `-help` option: `<program> -help`.

### On Linux

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
    ```
    ./board_test.fpga_emu
    ```
 2. Run the sample on the FPGA device.
    ```
    ./board_test.fpga
    ```
    By default the program runs all tests. To run a specific test, enter the test number as an argument to the `-test` option:
    ```
    ./board_test.fpga -test=<test_number>
    ```
### On Windows

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
    ```
    board_test.exe            (Windows)
    ```
    By default the program runs all tests. To run a specific test, enter the test number as an argument to the `-test` option:
    ```
    board_test.exe -test=<test_number>
    ```

### Build and Run the Samples on Intel® DevCloud (Optional)

When running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode.

Use the Linux instructions to build and run the program.

You can specify an FPGA runtime node using a single line script similar to the following example.

```
qsub -I -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2 -d .
```

- `-I` (upper case I) requests an interactive session.
- `-l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2` (lower case L) assigns one full node.
- `-d .` makes the current folder as the working directory for the task.

  |Available Nodes           |Command Options
  |:---                      |:---
  |FPGA Compile Time         |`qsub -l nodes=1:fpga_compile:ppn=2 -d .`
  |FPGA Runtime (Arria 10)   |`qsub -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:arria10:ppn=2 -d .`
  |FPGA Runtime (Stratix 10) |`qsub -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:stratix10:ppn=2 -d .`
  |GPU	                     |`qsub -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 -d .`
  |CPU	                     |`qsub -l nodes=1:xeon:ppn=2 -d .`

>**Note**: For more information on how to specify compute nodes read, [Launch and manage jobs](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/job-submission/) in the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI Documentation.

Only `fpga_compile` nodes support compiling to FPGA. When compiling for FPGA hardware, increase the job timeout to **24 hours**.

Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on `fpga_runtime` nodes of the appropriate type, such as `fpga_runtime:arria10` or `fpga_runtime:stratix10`.

Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI [*Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started*](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/) page.

>**Note**: Since Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI includes the appropriate development environment already configured, you do not need to set environment variables.
