## Purpose

This FPGA reference design demonstrates QR decomposition of matrices of complex/real numbers, a common operation employed in linear algebra. Matrix _A_ (input) is decomposed into a product of an orthogonal matrix _Q_ and an upper triangular matrix _R_.

The algorithms employed by the reference design are the Gram-Schmidt QR decomposition algorithm and the thin QR factorization method. Background information on these algorithms can be found in Wikipedia's [QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) article. The original algorithm has been modified and optimized for performance on FPGAs in this implementation.

QR decomposition is used extensively in signal processing applications such as beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing, and Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP).


### Matrix dimensions and FPGA resources

The QR decomposition algorithm factors a complex _m_ × _n_ matrix, where _m_ ≥ _n_. The algorithm computes the vector dot product of two columns of the matrix. In our FPGA implementation, the dot product is computed in a loop over the column's _m_ elements. The loop is fully unrolled to maximize throughput. As a result, *m* complex multiplication operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA, followed by sequential additions to compute the dot product result.

We use the compiler flag `-fp-relaxed`, which permits the compiler to reorder floating point additions (i.e. to assume that floating point addition is commutative). The compiler uses this freedom to reorder the additions so that the dot product arithmetic can be optimally implemented using the FPGA's specialized floating point DSP (Digital Signal Processing) hardware.

With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires 4*_m_ DSPs to compute the complex floating point dot product or 2*m* DSPs for the real case. Thus, the matrix size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP resources available.

By default, the design is parameterized to process 128 × 128 matrices when compiled targeting Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA. It is parameterized to process 256 × 256 matrices when compiled targeting Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), a larger device. However, the design can process matrices from 4 x 4 to 512 x 512.

## Key Implementation Details
| Kernel            | Description
---                 |---
| QRD               | Implements a modified Gram-Schmidt QR decomposition algorithm.

To optimize the performance-critical loop in its algorithm, the design leverages concepts discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:
* **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
* **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
* **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
* **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)

 The key optimization techniques used are as follows:
   1. Refactoring the original Gram-Schmidt algorithm to merge two dot products into one, reducing the total number of dot products needed to three from two. This helps us reduce the DSPs required for the implementation.
   2. Converting the nested loop into a single merged loop and applying Triangular Loop optimizations. This allows us to generate a design that is very well pipelined.
   3. Fully vectorizing the dot products using loop unrolling.
   4. Using the compiler flag -Xsfp-relaxed to re-order floating point operations and allowing the inference of a specialised dot-product DSP. This further reduces the number of DSP blocks needed by the implementation, the overall latency, and pipeline depth.
   5. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware.
   6. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert more pipeline stages where needed to improve the frequency achieved by the design.

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Code Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 24h.


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On a Linux* System
1. Install the design into a directory `build` from the design directory by running `cmake`:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   If you are compiling for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   If instead you are compiling for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following targets are provided, and they match the recommended development flow:

    * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga_emu
       ```

    * Generate HTML performance report. Find the report in `qrd_report.prj/reports/report.html`directory.

       ```
       make report
       ```

    * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga
       ```

3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/qrd.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System
1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:
   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * An FPGA hardware target is not provided on Windows*.

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.<br>

*Note:* If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.


### Troubleshooting
If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

     ```
     export CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE=32MB
     ./qrd.fpga_emu           (Linux)

     set CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE=32MB
     qrd.fpga_emu.exe         (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA device.
     ```
     ./qrd.fpga         (Linux)
     ```
