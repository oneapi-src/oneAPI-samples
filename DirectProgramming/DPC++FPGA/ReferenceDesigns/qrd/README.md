## Purpose

This FPGA reference design demonstrates QR decomposition of matrices of complex numbers, a common operation employed in linear algebra. Matrix _A_ (input) is decomposed into a product of an orthogonal matrix _Q_ and an upper triangular matrix _R_.

The algorithms employed by the reference design are the Gram-Schmidt QR decomposition algorithm and the thin QR factorization method. Background information on these algorithms can be found in Wikipedia's [QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) article. The original algorithm has been modified and optimized for performance on FPGAs in this implementation.

QR decomposition is used extensively in signal processing applications such as beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing, and Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP).


### Matrix dimensions and FPGA resources

The QR decomposition algorithm factors a complex _m_×_n_ matrix, where _m_ ≥ _n_. The algorithm computes the vector dot product of two columns of the matrix. In our FPGA implementation, the dot product is computed in a loop over the column's _m_ elements. The loop is fully unrolled to maximize throughput. As a result, *m* complex multiplication operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA, followed by sequential additions to compute the dot product result.

With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires 4*m* DSPs to compute the complex floating point dot product. Thus, the matrix size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP resources available. Note that this upper bound is a consequence of this particular implementation.

By default, the design is parameterized to process 128 × 128 matrices when compiled targeting Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA. It is parameterized to process 256 × 256 matrices when compiled targeting Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), a larger device.


## Key Implementation Details
| Kernel            | Description
---                 |---
| QRD               | Implements a modified Gram-Schmidt QR decomposition algorithm.

To optimize the performance-critical loop in its algorithm, the design leverages concepts discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:
* **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
* **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
* **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
* **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)

 The key optimization techniques used are as follows:
   1. Refactoring the algorithm to merge two dot products into one, reducing the total number of dot products needed to three from two. This helps us reduce the DSPs required for the implementation.
   2. Converting the nested loop into a single merged loop and applying Triangular Loop optimizations. This allows us to generate a design that is very well pipelined.
   3. Fully vectorizing the dot products using loop unrolling.
   4. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware.
   5. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert more pipeline stages where needed to improve the frequency achieved by the design.

## Building the Reference Design

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Code Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 24h.

### On a Linux* System
1. Install the design into a directory `build` from the design directory by running `cmake`:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   If you are compiling for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   If instead you are compiling for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following targets are provided, and they match the recommended development flow:

    * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga_emu
       ```

    * Generate HTML performance report. Find the report in `qrd_report.prj/reports/report.html`directory.

       ```
       make report
       ```

    * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga
       ```

3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/qrd.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System
1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:
   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * An FPGA hardware target is not provided on Windows*.

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this Reference Design in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Running the Reference Design
You can apply QR decomposition to a number of matrices, as shown below. This step performs the following:
* Generates the number of random matrices specified as the command line argument (defaults to 1).
* Computes QR decomposition on all matrices.
* Evaluates performance.
NOTE: The design is optimized to perform best when run on a large number of matrices, where the total number of matrices is a power of 2.


 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
 Increase the amount of memory that the emulator runtime is permitted to allocate by setting the CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE environment variable before running the executable.
     ```
     export CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE=32MB
     ./qrd.fpga_emu           (Linux)

     set CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE=32MB
     qrd.fpga_emu.exe         (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA device. It is recommended to pass in an optional argument (as shown) when invoking the sample on hardware. Otherwise, the performance will not be representative.
     ```
     ./qrd.fpga 40960         (Linux)
     ```

## Additional Design Information

### Compiler Flags Used

| Flag | Description
---    |---
`-Xshardware` | Target FPGA hardware (as opposed to FPGA emulator)
`-Xsclock=330MHz` | The FPGA backend attempts to achieve 330 MHz
`-Xsparallel=2` | Use 2 cores when compiling the bitstream through Quartus
`-Xsseed` | Specifies the Quartus compile seed, to yield slightly higher fMAX
`-DROWS_COMPONENT` | Specifies the number of rows of the matrix
`-DCOLS_COMPONENT` | Specifies the number of columns of the matrix
`-DFIXED_ITERATIONS` | Used to set the ivdep safelen attribute for the performance critical triangular loop

NOTE: The values for `seed`, `FIXED_ITERATIONS`, `ROWS_COMPONENT`, `COLS_COMPONENT` are set according to the board being targeted.

### Host Limitations
The QRD demo host is not optimized for a very large number of matrices. Running the QRD executable with number of matrices that occupy more memory than what is physically available on the host machine will result in system performance degradation due to virtual memory thrashing by the operating system.
