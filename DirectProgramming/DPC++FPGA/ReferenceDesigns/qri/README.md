## Purpose

This FPGA reference design demonstrates QR-based inversion of complex/real matrices, a common operation employed in linear algebra.

The algorithms employed by the reference design are the Gram-Schmidt QR decomposition algorithm and the thin QR factorization method. Background information on these algorithms can be found in Wikipedia's [QR decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_decomposition) article. The original algorithm has been modified and optimized for performance on FPGAs in this implementation.
The inverse of the input matrix A: inv(A) is then computed as inv(R) * transpose(Q).

### Matrix dimensions and FPGA resources

The QR-based matrix inversion algorithm factors a complex _n_ × _n_ matrix. The algorithm computes the QR decomposition of the input matrix. To do so, it computes the vector dot product of two columns of the matrix. In our FPGA implementation, the dot product is computed in a loop over the column's _n_ elements. The loop is fully unrolled to maximize throughput. As a result, *n* complex multiplication operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA, followed by sequential additions to compute the dot product result. The computation of the inverse of R also requires a dot product in a loop over _n_ elements. Finally, the final matrix multiplication also requires a dot product in a loop over _n_ elements.

We use the compiler flag `-fp-relaxed`, which permits the compiler to reorder floating point additions (i.e. to assume that floating point addition is commutative). The compiler uses this freedom to reorder the additions so that the dot product arithmetic can be optimally implemented using the FPGA's specialized floating point DSP (Digital Signal Processing) hardware.

Note: the compiler flag '-fp-relaxed' is planned to be deprecated.

With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires 4*_n_ DSPs to compute each of the complex floating point dot products or 2*_n_ DSPs in the real case. Thus, the matrix size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP resources available.

By default, the design is parameterized to process real floating-point matrices of size 32 × 32.


## Key Implementation Details
| Kernel            | Description
---                 |---
| QRD       | Implements a modified Gram-Schmidt QR decomposition algorithm.
| QRI       | Implements an inversion based on the provided Q and R matrices.

To optimize the performance-critical loop in its algorithm, the design leverages concepts discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:
* **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
* **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
* **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
* **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)
* **Shannonization** (shannonization)

 The key optimization techniques used are as follows:
   1. Refactoring the original Gram-Schmidt algorithm to merge two dot products of the QR decomposition into one, thus reducing the total number of dot products needed from three to two. This helps us reduce the DSPs required for the implementation.
   2. Converting the nested loop into a single merged loop and applying Triangular Loop optimizations. This allows us to generate a design that is very well pipelined.
   3. Fully vectorizing the dot products using loop unrolling.
   4. Using the compiler flag -Xsfp-relaxed to re-order floating point operations and allowing the inference of a specialised dot-product DSP. This further reduces the number of DSP blocks needed by the implementation, the overall latency, and pipeline depth.
   5. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware.
   6. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert more pipeline stages where needed to improve the frequency achieved by the design.
   7. Using the triangular loop optimization technique to maintain high throughput in triangular loops

## Building the Reference Design

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Code Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 24h.

### On a Linux* System
1. Install the design into a directory `build` from the design directory by running `cmake`:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   If you are compiling for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   If instead you are compiling for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following targets are provided, and they match the recommended development flow:

    * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga_emu
       ```

    * Generate HTML performance report. Find the report in `qrd_report.prj/reports/report.html`directory.

       ```
       make report
       ```

    * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga
       ```

3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/qrd.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System
1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:
   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * An FPGA hardware target is not provided on Windows*.

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.<br>
*Note:* If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this Reference Design in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)

## Running the Reference Design
You can perform the QR-based inversion of 8 matrices repeatedly, as shown below. This step performs the following:
* Generates 8 random matrices.
* Computes the QR-based inversion of the 8 matrices.
* Repeats the decomposition multiple times (specified as a command line argument) to evaluate performance.

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
 Increase the amount of memory that the emulator runtime is permitted to allocate by setting the CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE environment variable before running the executable.
     ```
     export CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE=32MB
     ./qri.fpga_emu           (Linux)

     set CL_CONFIG_CPU_FORCE_PRIVATE_MEM_SIZE=32MB
     qri.fpga_emu.exe         (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA device.
     ```
     ./qri.fpga               (Linux)
     ```
