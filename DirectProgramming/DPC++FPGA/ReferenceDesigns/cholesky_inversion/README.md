# Cholesky-based Inversion of Matrices
The `streaming_cholesky.hpp` linear algebra header library implements the Cholesky decomposition of matrices with pipe interfaces.
Similarly, the `streaming_cholesky_inversion.hpp` linear algebra header library implements the inversion of matrices with pipe interfaces, based on the outputs of the cholesky decomposition implemented in `streaming_cholesky.hpp`.
Both the decomposition and the inversion have template parameters that can be set to decompose/invert custom sized real or complex square matrices.
This SYCL*-compliant reference design demonstrates the use of these Cholesky decomposition and inversion header libraries on 32x32 real matrices.

| What you will learn               | How to implement high performance Cholesky matrix decomposition on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
| Time to complete                  | ~1 hr (excluding compile time)

## Purpose

This FPGA reference design demonstrates Cholesky-based matrix inversion, a common operation employed in linear algebra, through use of the streaming_cholesky.hpp and the streaming_cholesky_inversion.hpp header libraries.
The Cholesky decomposition takes a hermitian, positive-definite matrix $A$ (input) and computes the lower triangular matrix $L$ such that: 
$$ LL^{\star} = A $$
where $L^{\star}$ in the conjugate transpose of $L$.
Given this decomposition, the inverse of A can be computed as 
$$ A^{-1} = (LL^{\star})^{-1} = (L^{\star})^{-1}L^{-1} = (L^{-1})^{\star} L^{-1} $$
Therefore, in order to compute the inverse of A, one can: compute $LI$, the invert of $L$ (triangular matrix) and perform a matrix multiplication of the transpose of $LI$ by $LI$.
$$ A^{-1} = LI^{\star}LI $$
Because $A^{-1}$  is going to be symmetric, one can also compute only half of the values.

## Matrix Dimensions and FPGA resources

In this reference design, the Cholesky decomposition algorithm is used to factor a real _n_ × _n_ matrix. The algorithm computes the vector dot product of two rows of the matrix. In our FPGA implementation, the dot product is computed in a loop over the row's _n_ elements. The loop is fully unrolled to maximize throughput. As a result, *n* real multiplication operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA, followed by sequential additions to compute the dot product result.

We use the compiler option `-fp-relaxed`, which permits the compiler to reorder floating point additions (i.e. to assume that floating point addition is commutative). The compiler uses this freedom to reorder the additions so that the dot product arithmetic can be optimally implemented using the FPGA's specialized floating point DSP (Digital Signal Processing) hardware.

With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires _n_ DSPs to compute the real floating point dot product.
The input matrix is also replicated two times in order to be able to read two full rows per cycle.
Thus, the matrix size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP and RAM resources available.

The matrix inversion algorithm used in this reference design performs a Gaussian elimination to invert the triangular matrix _L_ obtained by the Cholesky decomposition.
To do so, another _n_ DSPs are required to perform the associated dot-product.
Finally, the matrix product of $LI^{\star}LI$ also requires _n_ DSPs.

A handful of extra DSPs are required to perform various arithmetic operations such as division, reciprocal square root, etc.

## Key Implementation Details
| Kernel                | Description
|:---                   |:---
| CholeskyDecomposition | Implements a modified Cholesky–Banachiewicz decomposition algorithm.
| CholeskyInversion     | Implements the matrix inversion based on the CholeskyDecomposition's outputs.

To optimize the performance-critical loops in these algorithms, the design leverages concepts discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:
- **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
- **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
- **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
- **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)

 The key optimization techniques used are:
   1. Traversing the matrix in a column fashion to increase the read-after-write (RAW) loop iteration distance 
   2. Using two copies of the compute matrix in order to be able to read a full row and a full column per cycle
   3. Converting the nested loop into a single merged loop and applying Triangular Loop optimizations. This allows us to generate a design that is very well pipelined.
   4. Fully vectorizing the dot products using loop unrolling.
   5. Using the compiler flag -Xsfp-relaxed to re-order floating point operations and allowing the inference of a specialized dot-product DSP. This further reduces the number of DSP blocks needed by the implementation, the overall latency, and pipeline depth.
   6. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware (all local memories are single-read, single-write).
   7. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert more pipeline stages where needed to improve the frequency achieved by the design.
   8. Using the input matrices properties (hermitian positive matrices) to reduce the number of operations. For example, the (_LI_*) * _LI_ computation only requires to compute half of the output matrix as the result is symmetric.

## Building the Reference Design

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Run Code Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the type of compute node and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. Compiles to FPGA are only supported on fpga_compile nodes. Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on fpga_runtime nodes of the appropriate type, such as fpga_runtime:arria10 or fpga_runtime:stratix10.  Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to **24h**.


### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see the 
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.

### On Linux*
1. Install the design into a directory `build` from the design directory by running `cmake`:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   If you are compiling for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   If instead you are compiling for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following targets are provided, and they match the recommended development flow:

    - Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga_emu
       ```

    - Generate HTML performance report. Find the report in `cholesky_inversion_report.prj/reports/report.html`directory.

       ```
       make report
       ```

    - Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga
       ```

3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, you can download FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) from [https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/cholesky_inversion.fpga.tar.gz](https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/cholesky_inversion.fpga.tar.gz).

### On Windows*

   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

     ```

> **Note**: The Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA and Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.<br>

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.
