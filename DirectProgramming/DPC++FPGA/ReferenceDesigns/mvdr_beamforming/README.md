# MVDR Beamforming

## Purpose
The purpose of this reference design is to implement a high-performance streaming IO design using DPC++. In this reference design, we implement an MVDR-beamforming algorithm using oneAPI. More details on the algorithm can be found in the [Additional Design Information](#additional-design-information) Section.

## Key Implementation Details
This reference design code sample leverages concepts that are discussed in the following FPGA tutorials: 
* **IO Streaming** (io_streaming)
* **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_reg)
* **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
* **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
* **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)
* **Pipe Arrays** (pipe_array)

Notably, we strongly suggest reviewing the **IO Streaming** code sample as this reference design is a direct extension of the concepts it describes.  That code sample clearly illustrates the concept of 'fake' IO Pipes, which is used heavily in this reference design.

## Building the Reference Design

### Include Files
The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Code Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (fpga_compile, fpga_runtime:arria10, or fpga_runtime:stratix10) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information, see the Intel&reg; oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 24h.
 
### On a Linux* System
1. Install the design into a directory `build` from the design directory by running `cmake`:

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   If you are compiling for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   If instead you are compiling for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following targets are provided, and they match the recommended development flow:

    * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga_emu
       ```

    * Generate optimization report. Find the report in `mvdr_beamforming_report.prj/reports/report.html` directory.

       ```
       make report
       ```

    * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).

       ```
       make fpga
       ```

3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/mvdr_beamforming.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System
1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:
   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     nmake report
     ``` 
   * An FPGA hardware target is not provided on Windows*. 

*Note:* The Intel&reg; PAC with Intel Arria&reg; 10 GX FPGA and Intel&reg; FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix&reg; 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run this Reference Design in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*).

## Running the Reference Design

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
     ```

     ./mvdr_beamforming.fpga_emu.exe --in=../data     (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA device.
     ```
     ./mvdr_beamforming.fpga --in=../data             (Linux)
     ```

### MVDR Beamforming
This reference design is built upon the **IO Streaming** code sample.

The images below show the dataflow in the MVDR beamforming design. The first image shows the "real" dataflow when IO pipes are used at the inputs and outputs. The second image shows the data flow in this reference design where we don't have access to a BSP with IO pipes. The `XrxTrainingProducer` and `XrxDataProducer` are the kernels that replace the input IO pipe in the first image. Note that the splitting of data (shown as a black dot with two outward arrows in the first image) is done by the host using `XrxTrainingProducer` and `XrxDataProducer`. The `DataOutConsumer` kernel replaces the output IO pipe in the first image. The data for the `SteeringVectorGenerator` kernel still comes from the host through the `SinThetaProducer` kernel. This kernel does not replace an IO pipe but simplifies and modularizes the host's data streaming to the device.
