# CRR Binomial Tree Model for Option Pricing
An FPGA-optimized reference design computing the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial tree model with Greeks for American exercise options.

The [FPGA Optimization Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide)  provides comprehensive instructions for targeting FPGAs through DPC++. The [oneAPI Programming Guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi-programming-guide) is a resource for general target-independent DPC++ programming.  Additional reference material specific to option pricing algorithms is provided in the References section of this README.

## Purpose
This sample implements the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR) binomial tree model that is used in the finance field for American exercise options with five Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega and rho). The simple idea is to model all possible assets price paths using a binomial tree.

## Key Implementation Details

### Design Inputs
This design reads inputs from the `ordered_inputs.csv` file. The inputs are:

| Input                             | Description
---                                 |---
| `n_steps`                         | Number of time steps in the binomial tree. The maximum `n_steps` in this design is 8189.
| `cp`                              | -1 or 1 represents put and call options, respectively.
| `spot`                            | Spot price of the underlying price.
| `fwd`                             | Forward price of the underlying price.
| `strike`                          | Exercise price of the option.
| `vol`                             | Percent volatility that the design reads as a decimal value.
| `df`                              | Discount factor to option expiry.
| `t`                               | Time, in years, to the maturity of the option.

### Design Outputs
This design writes outputs to the `ordered_outputs.csv` file. The outputs are:

| Output                            | Description
---                                 |---
| `value`                           | Option price
| `delta`                           | Measures the rate of change of the theoretical option value with respect to changes in the underlying asset's price.
| `gamma`                           | Measures the rate of change in the `delta` with respect to changes in the underlying price.
| `vega`                            | Measures sensitivity to volatility.
| `theta`                           | Measures the sensitivity of the value of the derivative to the passage of time.
| `rho`                             | Measures sensitivity to the interest of rate.

### Design Correctness
This design tests the correctness of the optimized FPGA code by comparing its output to a golden result computed on the CPU.

### Design Performance
This design measures the FPGA performance to determine how many assets can be processed per second.

## Building the CRR Program 

### Include Files
The included header `dpc_common.hpp` is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on your development system.

### Running Samples in DevCloud
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the compute node (FPGA) as well as whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide ([https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/)).

When compiling for FPGA hardware, it is recommended to increase the job timeout to 48h.

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA), run `cmake` using the command:
 
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
 
2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:
 
   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     make report
     ``` 
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device): 
     ```
     make fpga
     ``` 
3. (Optional) As the above hardware compile may take several hours to complete, FPGA precompiled binaries (compatible with Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04) can be downloaded <a href="https://iotdk.intel.com/fpga-precompiled-binaries/latest/crr.fpga.tar.gz" download>here</a>.

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
     ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run `cmake` using the command:  
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA), run `cmake` using the command:

   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device): 
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report: 
     ```
     nmake report
     ``` 
   * An FPGA hardware target is not provided on Windows*. 

*Note:* The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX FPGA) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

 ### In Third-Party Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
 
You can compile and run this tutorial in the Eclipse* IDE (in Linux*) and the Visual Studio* IDE (in Windows*). For instructions, refer to the following link: [Intel® oneAPI DPC++ FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide)
