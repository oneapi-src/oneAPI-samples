| Terasic’s DE10-Agilex Development Board           | 144k matrices/s for single-precision floating-point matrices of size 64 * 64, computed using a systolic array of 8 * 8 PEs (64 DSPs)

## Key Implementation Details

The matrix multiplication algorithm multiplies two single-precision floating-point matrices *A* (*m × n*) and *B* (*n × p*) to produce matrix *C* (*m × p*). The algorithm is implemented using a systolic array approach, employing an array of *m<sub>PE</sub> × p<sub>PE</sub>* PEs, each of which is responsible for computing a dot product corresponding to an element of the output matrix. As a result, this implementation computes the matrix multiplication in tiles of *m<sub>PE</sub> × p<sub>PE</sub>* at a time.

<p align="center">
  <img src=assets/overview.png />
</p>

Each iteration, a PE consumes inputs from previous PEs in the same row or column and uses these data to compute a multiply-accumulate. It then passes the inputs along to the next PE. We orchestrate the flow of data through the systolic array such that each PE is responsible for computing one element of the output matrix. Using this approach, it takes a total of *n* iterations to compute one matrix product, where every iteration, we compute a partial sum for each of the elements of the output matrix.

<p align="center">
  <img src=assets/systolic_array.png />
</p>

Here, a single PE consists of logic to compute a floating-point multiply-accumulate and registers for storage of intermediate results. 

<p align="center">
  <img src=assets/PE.png />
</p>

In our FPGA implementation, the multiply-accumulate operations are computed in a nested loop over the PEs. The loop is fully unrolled to replicate the hardware for each PE. 

```c++
#pragma unroll
for (int row = 0; row < m_PE; row++) {
  #pragma unroll
  for (int col = 0; col < p_PE; col++) {
    fed_a[i] = fpga_reg(fed_a[i]);
    fed_b[j] = fpga_reg(fed_b[j]);
    accum[i][j] += fed_a[i] * fed_b[j];
    ...
  }
}
```

As a result, *m<sub>PE</sub> × p<sub>PE</sub>* multiply-accumulate operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA.  The multiply-accumulate arithmetic can be optimally implemented using the FPGA's specialized floating point DSP (Digital Signal Processing) hardware. When set to FP accum mode, we can perform this operation with an II of 1. With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires *m<sub>PE</sub> × p<sub>PE</sub>* DSPs to compute all the floating-point multiply-accumulate operations. Thus, the matrix tile size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP resources available.

To optimize the performance-critical loop in its algorithm, the design leverages concepts discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:

- **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
- **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)

The key optimization techniques used are as follows:

1. Fully unrolling the loop over the matrix product to instantiate an array of individual PEs in hardware.
2. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert additional pipelining registers, a crucial step in the implementation of the systolic array structure of this design, which allows data to be passed from one PE to the next. The use of these registers both in the systolic array and in various other parts of the design improves the overall achievable frequency.
3. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware.

### Comparison with a naïve approach

Consider the following naïve implementation of a matrix multiplication kernel, where instead of implementing a systolic array, we unroll the loop computing the dot product. 
```c++
for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
  for (int col = 0; col < p; col++) {
    float dot_prod{0};
#pragma unroll
    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
      dot_prod = fpga_reg(dot_prod) + a_load[row][k] * b_load[col][k];
    }
    mm_result[row][col] = dot_prod;
  }
}
```

This achieves the same objective of increasing throughput, though this design is not as scalable as the systolic array approach, as shown in the results below.

*Systolic array implementation*
| Matrix size | PE array size | DSP usage | Avg. fMAX
|:---         |:---           |:---       |:---
| 64x64       | 8x8           | 64        | 452.55 MHz
| 256x256     | 16x16         | 256       | 380.00 MHz

*Naïve implementation*
| Matrix size | Dot product size | DSP usage | Avg. fMAX
|:---         |:---              |:---       | :---   
| 64x64       | 64               | 64        | 435.28 MHz   
| 256x256     | 256              | 256       | 341.08 MHz


These results were gathered from targeting the Arria® 10 device family using the SYCL HLS flow, and the fMAX values were averaged across 6 seeds.

### Compiler Flags Used

| Flag              | Description
|:---               |:---
| `-Xshardware`     | Target FPGA hardware (as opposed to FPGA emulator)
| `-Xsclock=360MHz` | The FPGA backend attempts to achieve 360 MHz
| `-Xsseed`         | Specifies the Intel® Quartus® compile seed, to yield slightly higher fmax

Additionaly, the cmake build system can be configured using the following parameters:

| cmake option   | Description
|:---            |:---
| `-DSET_ROWS_A` | Specifies *m*, the number of rows of matrix A
| `-DSET_COMMON` | Specifies *n*, the number of columns of matrix A / rows of matrix B (these values are equal)
| `-DSET_COLS_B` | Specifies *p*, the number of columns of matrix B
| `-DSET_TILE_A` | Specifies *m<sub>PE</sub>*, the tile size used on matrix A
| `-DSET_TILE_B` | Specifies *p<sub>PE</sub>*, the tile size used on matrix B

>**Note**: The default values for `-Xsseed`, `-DSET_ROWS_A`, `-DSET_COMMON`, `-DSET_COLS_B`, `-DSET_TILE_A` and `-DSET_TILE_B` depend on the board being targeted.

## Build the `Matrix multiply` Design

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. 
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. 
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

- Computes the product of the set of matrices.
- Repeats the multiplication multiple times (specified as a command line argument) to evaluate performance.
