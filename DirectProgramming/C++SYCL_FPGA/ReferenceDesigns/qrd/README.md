## Purpose

This FPGA reference design demonstrates QR decomposition of matrices of complex/real numbers, a common operation employed in linear algebra. Matrix *A* (input) is decomposed into a product of an orthogonal matrix *Q* and an upper triangular matrix *R*.

The algorithms employed by the reference design are the **Gram-Schmidt process** QR decomposition algorithm and the thin **QR factorization** method. The original algorithm has been modified and optimized for performance on FPGAs in this implementation.

QR decomposition is used extensively in signal processing applications such as beamforming, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing, and Space Time Adaptive Processing (STAP).

## Key Implementation Details

The QR decomposition algorithm factors a complex _m_ × _n_ matrix, where _m_ ≥ _n_. The algorithm computes the vector dot product of two columns of the matrix. In our FPGA implementation, the dot product is computed in a loop over the column's _m_ elements. The loop is unrolled fully to maximize throughput. The *m* complex multiplication operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA followed by sequential additions to compute the dot product result.

With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires 4*m* DSPs to compute the complex floating point dot product or 2*m* DSPs for the real case. The matrix size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP resources available.

By default, the design is parameterized to process 128 × 128 matrices when compiled targeting an Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA. It is parameterized to process 256 × 256 matrices when compiled targeting a Intel® Stratix® 10 or Intel® Agilex® 7 FPGA; however, the design can process matrices from 4 x 4 to 512 x 512.

To optimize the performance-critical loop in its algorithm, the design leverages concepts discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:

- **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
- **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
- **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
- **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)

The key optimization techniques used are as follows:

1. Refactoring the original Gram-Schmidt algorithm to merge two dot products into one, reducing the total number of dot products needed to three from two. This helps us reduce the DSPs required for the implementation.
2. Converting the nested loop into a single merged loop and applying Triangular Loop optimizations. This allows us to generate a design that is very well pipelined.
3. Fully vectorizing the dot products using loop unrolling.
4. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware.
5. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert more pipeline stages where needed to improve the frequency achieved by the design.

### Compiler Flags Used

| Flag                  | Description
|:---                   |:---
| `-Xshardware`         | Target FPGA hardware (as opposed to FPGA emulator)
| `-Xsclock=360MHz`     | The FPGA backend attempts to achieve 360 MHz
| `-Xsparallel=2`       | Use 2 cores when compiling the bitstream through Intel® Quartus®
| `-Xsseed`             | Specifies the Intel® Quartus® compile seed, to yield slightly higher fmax

Additionaly, the cmake build system can be configured using the following parameters:

| cmake option              | Description
|:---                       |:---
| `-DSET_ROWS_COMPONENT`    | Specifies the number of rows of the matrix
| `-DSET_COLS_COMPONENT`    | Specifies the number of columns of the matrix
| `-DSET_FIXED_ITERATIONS`  | Used to set the ivdep safelen attribute for the performance critical triangular loop
| `-DSET_COMPLEX`           | Used to select between the complex and real QR decomposition (complex is the default)

>**Note**: The values for `seed`, `-DSET_FIXED_ITERATIONS`, `-DSET_ROWS_COMPONENT`, `-DSET_COLS_COMPONENT` and `-DSET_COMPLEX` depend on the board being targeted.

## Build the `QRD` Design

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulator FPGA device):

>**Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example `C:\samples\build`. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
## Run the `QRD` Design

### Configurable Parameters

| Argument  | Description
|:---       |:---
| `<num>`   | (Optional) Specifies the number of times to repeat the decomposition of a set of 8 matrices (only 1 matrix when running simulation). Its default value is **16** for the emulation flow, **1** for the simulation flow and **819200** for the FPGA flow.

You can perform the QR decomposition of the set of matrices repeatedly. This step performs the following:
- Generates the set of random matrices.
- Computes the QR decomposition of the set of matrices.
- Repeats the decomposition multiple times (specified as a command line argument) to evaluate performance.
