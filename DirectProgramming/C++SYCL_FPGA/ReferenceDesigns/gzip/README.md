## Purpose

This reference design implements a compression algorithm. The implementation is optimized for the FPGA device. The compression result is GZIP-compatible and can be decompressed with GUNZIP. The GZIP output file format is compatible with the GZIP DEFLATE algorithm and follows a fixed subset (see RFC 1951). (See the [Additional References](#additional-references) section for specific references.)

## Key Implementation Details

The GZIP DEFLATE algorithm uses a GZIP-compatible Limpel-Ziv 77 (LZ77) algorithm for data de-duplication and a GZIP-compatible Static Huffman algorithm for bit reduction. The implementation includes three FPGA accelerated tasks (LZ77, Static Huffman, and CRC).

The FPGA implementation of the algorithm enables either one or two independent GZIP compute engines to operate in parallel on the FPGA. The available FPGA resources constrain the number of engines. By default, the design is parameterized to create a single engine when the design is compiled to target an Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA. Two engines are created when compiling for Intel® Stratix® 10 or Agilex® 7 FPGAs, which are a larger device.

This reference design contains two variants: "High Bandwidth" and "Low-Latency."

- The High Bandwidth variant maximizes system throughput without regard for latency. It transfers input/output SYCL Buffers to FPGA-attached DDR. The kernel then operates on these buffers.
- The Low-Latency variant takes advantage of Universal Shared Memory (USM) to avoid these copy operations, allowing the GZIP engine to access input/output buffers in host-memory directly. This reduces latency, but throughput is also reduced. "Latency" in this context is defined as the duration of time between when the input buffer is available in host memory to when the output buffer (i.e., the compressed result) is available in host memory.
The Low-Latency variant is only supported on USM capable BSPs, or when targeting an FPGA family/part number.

| Kernel          | Description
|:---             |:---
| LZ Reduction    | Implements an LZ77 algorithm for data de-duplication. The algorithm produces distance and length information that is compatible with the GZIP DEFLATE implementation.
| Static Huffman  | Uses the same Static Huffman codes used by GZIP's DEFLATE algorithm when it chooses a Static Huffman coding scheme for bit reduction. This choice maintains compatibility with GUNZIP.
| CRC             | Adds a CRC checksum based on the input file; the gzip file format requires this

To optimize performance, GZIP leverages techniques discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:
* **Double Buffering to Overlap Kernel Execution with Buffer Transfers and Host Processing** (double_buffering)
* **On-Chip Memory Attributes** (mem_config)

## Build the `GZIP` Design

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).


### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

   For the **low latency** version of the design, add `-DLOW_LATENCY=1` to your `cmake` command.

   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
       ```
       make fpga_emu
       ```
   2. Compile for simulation (medium compile time, targets simulated FPGA device):

      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   3. Generate the HTML performance report.
       ```
       make report
       ```
       The report resides at `gzip_report.prj/reports/report/report.html`.

   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
       ```
       make fpga
       ```

### On Windows*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```

   For the **low latency** version of the design, add `-DLOW_LATENCY=1` to your `cmake` command.

  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1
  >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Compile for simulation (medium compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_sim
      ```
   3. Generate the HTML performance report.
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
      The report resides at `gzip_report.a.prj/reports/report/report.html`.
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example `c:\samples\build`. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```

| `<input_file>`       | Specifies the file to be compressed. <br> Use an 120+ MB file to achieve peak performance. <br> Use an 80 KB file for Low Latency variant. <br> Use a smaller file such as an 100 B file if the simulator flow is taking too long.
| `-o=<output_file>`   | Specifies the name of the output file. The default name of the output file is `<input_file>.gz`. <br> When using two engines, the single `<input_file>` is fed to both engines, yielding two identical output files, using `<output_file>` as the basis for the filenames.
