# `MVDR Beamforming` Sample

This reference design demonstrates IO streaming using SYCL* on an FPGA for a large system. The IO streaming is 'faked' using data from the host.

| Category             | Reference Designs and End to End

## Purpose

The purpose of this reference design is to implement a high-performance streaming IO design. In this reference design, we implement an MVDR-beamforming algorithm using oneAPI.

This reference design code sample leverages concepts that are discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:

- **IO Streaming** (io_streaming)
- **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_reg)
- **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
- **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
- **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)
- **Pipe Arrays** (pipe_array)

You should review the **IO Streaming** code sample as this reference design is a direct extension of the concepts described in that tutorial. The IO Streaming sample code clearly illustrates the concept of 'fake' IO Pipes, which is used heavily in this reference design.

## Prerequisites

This sample is part of the FPGA code samples.
It is categorized as a Tier 4 sample that demonstrates a reference design.

## Key Implementation Details

### MVDR Beamforming

>**Note**: This reference design is built upon the **IO Streaming** sample code and concepts. Review that tutorial for more information.

The images below show the data flow in the MVDR beamforming design. The first image shows the "real" data flow when IO pipes are used at the inputs and outputs. The second image shows the data flow in this reference design where we don't have access to a BSP with IO pipes.

![processing_kernels_ideal](assets/processing_kernels_ideal.png)

![processing_kernels_fake](assets/processing_kernels_fake.png)

The `DataProducer` kernel replaces the input IO pipe in the first image. The splitting of data between the training and beamforming pipelines is done by the `InputDemux` kernel. The `DataOutConsumer` kernel replaces the output IO pipe in the first image. The data for the `SteeringVectorGenerator` kernel still comes from the host through the `SinThetaProducer` kernel. This kernel does not replace an IO pipe but simplifies and modularizes the host's data streaming to the device.

## Build the `MVDR Beamforming` Design

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulator FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   3. Generate the HTML performance report.
      ```
      make report
      ```
      The report resides at `mvdr_beamforming_report.prj/reports/report.html`.

   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga
      ```

### On Windows*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```

  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1

  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulator FPGA device):
      ```
      nmake fpga_sim
      ```
   3. Generate the HTML performance report.
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
      The report resides at `mvdr_beamforming_report.a.prj/reports/report.html`.

   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```
> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example `c:\samples\build`. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```

## Build and Run the Design Using Real IO-pipes

This section describes how to build and run this reference design on a BSP with real IO pipes. The real IO pipes version does **not** work on Windows and requires a specific system setup and BSP.

>**Note**: This design requires a specific board support package (BSP) with a distinct hardware configuration. For access to this BSP or general customer support, submit a case through Intel® Premier Support (IPS) or contact your Intel or Distribution Sales Representative.

### Build on Linux

1. Build the loopback test and reference design with real IO pipes.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake .. -DREAL_IO_PIPES=1 -DFPGA_DEVICE=<your_io_pipe_capable_bsp>
   ```
   The `REAL_IO_PIPES` cmake flag defines a variable that is used *exclusively* in `mvdr_beamforming.cpp` to create a kernel system using real IO pipes, as opposed to the fake IO pipes described earlier in this document.

2. Build the loopback test only.
   ```
   make udp_loopback_test
   ```
3. Build the MVDR reference design only.
   ```
   make fpga
   ```
