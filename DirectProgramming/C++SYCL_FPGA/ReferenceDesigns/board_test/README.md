## Key Implementation Details

A oneAPI Board Support Package (BSP) consists of software layers and an FPGA hardware scaffold design, making it possible to target an FPGA through the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.

The compiler stitches the generated FPGA design into the oneAPI BSP framework. Refer to the [Intel® oneAPI Programming Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/programming-interface/fpga-flow/fpga-bsps-and-boards.html) for information about oneAPI BSPs.

The BSP hardware components typically comprise RTL for all interfaces the oneAPI kernel requires; for example, a PCIe IP for the host to kernel communication, EMIF (External Memory Interface) IP for kernel to memory, and host to FPGA board memory communication among other things.

The BSP software components typically consist of a Memory Mapped Device (MMD) layer and a driver. The implementation is vendor-dependent.

The BSP consists of components operating at different clock domains. PCIe and external memories operate at a fixed frequency. Corresponding RTL IPs are parametrized to operate at these fixed frequencies by platform vendors. The kernel clock frequency varies and is calculated as part of the oneAPI offline compilation flow for FPGAs. The BSP has logic to handle the data transfer across these clock domains.

`Board Test` measures the frequency that the kernel is running at in the FPGA and compares this to the compiled kernel clock frequency.

The following block diagram shows an overview of a typical oneAPI FPGA BSP hardware design and the numbered arrows depict the following:

- Path 1 represents the host to kernel interface.
- Path 2 represents the host-to-device global memory interface.
- Path 3 represents the kernel-to-device global memory interface.
- Path 4 represents the kernel-to-shared host memory interface

### Source Code Explanation

| File               | Description
|:---                |:---
| `board_test.cpp`   | Contains the `main()` function and the test selection logic as well as calls to each test.
| `board_test.hpp`   | Contains the definitions for all the individual tests in the sample.
| `host_speed.hpp`   | Header for host speed test. Contains definition of functions used in host speed test.
| `usm_speed.hpp`    | Header for the USM bandwidth test. Contains definitions of functions used in the USM bandwidth test.
| `helper.hpp`       | Contains constants (for example, binary name) used throughout the code as well as definition of functions that print help and measure execution time.

### Compiler Flags Used

| Flag                  | Description
|:---                   |:---
`-Xsno-interleaving`    | By default oneAPI compiler burst interleaves across same memory type.  `-Xsno-interleaving` disables burst interleaving and enables testing each memory bank independently. (See the [FPGA Optimization Guide for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits Developer Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide/top/flags-attr-prag-ext/optimization-flags/disabl-burst-int.html) for more information.)

### Performance

Performance results are based on testing as of Jan 31, 2022.

> **Note**: Refer to the [Performance Disclaimers](/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/README.md#performance-disclaimers) section for important performance information.

## Build the `Board Test` Program

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. 
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. 
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ``` 
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command: 
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ``` 
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

## Run the `Board Test` Executable

The `Board Test` program checks following interfaces in a platform:

- **Host-to-device global memory interface:** This interface is checked by performing explicit data movement between the host and device global memory. Host to device global memory bandwidth is measured and reported. As a part of this interface check, unaligned data transfers are also performed to verify that non-DMA transfers complete successfully.

- **Kernel-to-device global memory interface:** This interface is checked by performing kernel to memory data transfers using simple read and write kernels. Kernel to memory bandwidth is measured and reported.

- **Host-to-kernel interface:** The test ensures that the host to kernel communication is correct and that the host can launch a kernel successfully. It also measures the roundtrip kernel launch latency and throughput (number of kernels/ms) of single task no-operation kernels.

- **Unified shared memory (USM) interface:** This interface is checked by copying data between, reading data from, and writing data to host USM. The bandwidth is measured and reported for each case. Applies only to board variants with USM support; to run this test you must specify the `SUPPORTS_USM` macro at compile-time; e.g., `cmake .. -DSUPPORTS_USM=1`.

- **Kernel clock frequency:** The test measures the frequency the programmed kernel is running at on the FPGA device and reports it. By default, this test fails if the measured frequency is not within 2% of the compiled frequency.

  >**Note**: Kernel clock frequency test measures the frequency that the programmed kernel is running at on the FPGA device and reports it. By default, this test fails if the measured frequency is not within 2% of the compiled frequency. The test allows overriding this failure; however, overriding might lead to functional errors, and it is not recommended. The override option is provided to allow debug in case where platform design changes are done to force kernel to run at slower clock (this is not a common use-case). To override, set the `report_chk` variable to `false` in `board_test.cpp` and recompile only the host code by using the `-reuse-exe=board_test.fpga` option in your compile command.


### Configurable Parameters

The complete board test is divided into six subtests. By default, all tests run. You can choose to run a single test by using the `-test=<test number>` option. Refer to the [Running the Sample](#running-the-sample) section for test usage instructions.
