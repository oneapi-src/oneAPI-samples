| What you will learn     | How to implement high performance matrix Cholesky decomposition on FPGAs.
| Time to complete        | ~1 hr (excluding compile time)

## Purpose

The `Cholesky Decomposition` sample includes the `streaming_cholesky.hpp` linear algebra header library, which implements the Cholesky decomposition of matrices with pipe interfaces.

Cholesky decomposition is used extensively in machine learning applications such as least-squares regressions and Monte-Carlo simulations.

This FPGA reference design demonstrates Cholesky decomposition, a common operation employed in linear algebra, through use of the `streaming_cholesky.hpp` header library. The Cholesky decomposition takes a hermitian, positive-definite matrix _A_ (input) and computes the lower triangular matrix _L_ such that: _L_ * _L*_ = A, where _L*_ in the conjugate transpose of _L_.
The algorithm employed by the header library is an FPGA throughput optimized version of the Cholesky–Banachiewicz algorithm. (You can find information on the Cholesky decomposition and this algorithm can be found in the [Cholesky decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition) article on Wikipedia.)

You can set the template parameters to decompose custom-sized real or complex square matrices.

## Key Implementation Details

The kernel is Cholesky, which implements a modified Cholesky–Banachiewicz Cholesky decomposition algorithm. To optimize the performance-critical loop in the algorithm, the design uses the several concepts discussed in the FPGA tutorial.

- **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
- **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
- **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
- **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)

The following list shows the key optimization techniques included in the reference design.
1. Traversing the matrix in a column fashion to increase the read-after-write (RAW) loop iteration distance.
2. Using two copies of the compute matrix to read a full row and a full column per cycle.
3. Converting the nested loop into a single merged loop and applying Triangular Loop optimizations. This approach enables the ability to generate a design that is pipelined efficiently.
4. Fully vectorizing the dot products using loop unrolling.
5. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware (all local memories are single-read, single-write).
6. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert more pipeline stages where needed to improve the frequency achieved by the design.

### Matrix Dimensions and FPGA Resources

In this reference design, the Cholesky decomposition algorithm is used to factor a real _n_ × _n_ matrix. The algorithm computes the vector dot product of two rows of the matrix. In our FPGA implementation, the dot product is computed in a loop over the _n_ elements in the row. The loop is fully unrolled to maximize throughput, so *n* real multiplication operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA and followed by sequential additions to compute the dot product result.

With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires _n_ DSPs to compute the real floating point dot product. The input matrix is also replicated two times in order to be able to read two full rows per cycle. The matrix size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP and RAM resources available.

### Compiler Flags Used

| Flag                        | Description
|:---                         |:---
|`-Xshardware`                | Target FPGA hardware (as opposed to FPGA emulator)
|`-Xsclock=<target fmax>MHz`  | The FPGA backend attempts to achieve <target fmax> MHz
|`-Xsparallel=2`              | Use 2 cores when compiling the bitstream through Quartus
|`-Xsseed`                    | Specifies the Quartus compile seed, to potentially yield slightly higher fmax

Additionaly, the cmake build system can be configured using the following parameters:

| cmake option                | Description
|:---                         |:---
|`-DSET_MATRIX_DIMENSION`     | Specifies the number of rows/columns of the matrix
|`-DSET_FIXED_ITERATIONS`     | Used to set the ivdep safelen attribute for the performance critical triangular loop
|`-DSET_COMPLEX`              | Used to select between the complex and real QR decomposition (real is the default)

> **Note**: The values for `-Xsseed`, `-DSET_MATRIX_DIMENSION`, `-DSET_FIXED_ITERATIONS`, and `-DSET_COMPLEX` depend on the board being targeted.

### Source Code

These source files are in the sample `src` directory.

## Build the `Cholesky Decomposition` Reference Design

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```

>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
