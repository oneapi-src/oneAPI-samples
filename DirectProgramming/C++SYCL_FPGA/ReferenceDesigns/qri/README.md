## Purpose

This FPGA reference design demonstrates QR-based inversion of real and complex matrices, a common operation employed in linear algebra.

The algorithms employed by the reference design are the **Gram-Schmidt process** QR decomposition algorithm and the thin **QR factorization** method. The original algorithm has been modified and optimized for performance on FPGAs in this implementation.

The inverse of the input matrix A: inv(A) is then computed as inv(R) * transpose(Q).

## Key Implementation Details

The QR-based matrix inversion algorithm factors a complex *n* × *n* matrix. The algorithm computes the QR decomposition of the input matrix. To do so, it computes the vector dot product of two columns of the matrix. In our FPGA implementation, the dot product is computed in a loop over the column's *n* elements. The loop is fully unrolled to maximize throughput. As a result, *n* complex multiplication operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA, followed by sequential additions to compute the dot product result. The computation of the inverse of R also requires a dot product in a loop over *n* elements. Finally, the final matrix multiplication also requires a dot product in a loop over *n* elements.

With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires 4*_n_ DSPs to compute each of the complex floating point dot products or 2*_n_ DSPs in the real case. Thus, the matrix size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP resources available.

By default, the design is parameterized to process real floating-point matrices of size 32 × 32.

To optimize the performance-critical loop in its algorithm, the design leverages concepts discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:

- **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
- **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
- **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
- **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)
- **Shannonization** (shannonization)

The key optimization techniques used are as follows:
1. Refactoring the original Gram-Schmidt algorithm to merge two dot products of the QR decomposition into one, thus reducing the total number of dot products needed from three to two. This helps us reduce the DSPs required for the implementation.
2. Converting the nested loop into a single merged loop and applying Triangular Loop optimizations. This allows us to generate a design that is very well pipelined.
3. Fully vectorizing the dot products using loop unrolling.
4. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware.
5. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert more pipeline stages where needed to improve the frequency achieved by the design.
6. Using the triangular loop optimization technique to maintain high throughput in triangular loops

### Compiler Flags Used

| Flag                      | Description
|:---                       |:---
| `-Xshardware`             | Target FPGA hardware (as opposed to FPGA emulator)
| `-Xsclock=330MHz`         | The FPGA backend attempts to achieve 330 MHz
| `-Xsparallel=2`           | Use 2 cores when compiling the bitstream through Intel® Quartus®
| `-Xsseed`                 | Specifies the Intel® Quartus® compile seed, to yield slightly higher fmax

Additionaly, the cmake build system can be configured using the following parameters:

| cmake option                  | Description
|:---                           |:---
| `-DSET_ROWS_COMPONENT`        | Specifies the number of rows of the matrix
| `-DSET_COLS_COMPONENT`        | Specifies the number of columns of the matrix
| `-DSET_FIXED_ITERATIONS_QRD`  | Used to set the ivdep safelen attribute for the performance critical triangular loop in the QR decomposition kernel
| `-DSET_FIXED_ITERATIONS_QRI`  | Used to set the ivdep safelen attribute for the performance critical triangular loop in the QR inversion kernel
| `-DSET_COMPLEX`               | Used to select between the complex and real QR decomposition/inversion

>**Note**: The values for `-Xsseed`, `-DSET_FIXED_ITERATIONS_QRD`, `-DSET_FIXED_ITERATIONS_QRI`, `-DSET_ROWS_COMPONENT`, `-DSET_COLS_COMPONENT` and `-DSET_COMPLEX` depend on the board being targeted.

## Build the `QRI` Sample

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt

- Repeats the decomposition multiple times (specified as a command line argument) to evaluate performance.
