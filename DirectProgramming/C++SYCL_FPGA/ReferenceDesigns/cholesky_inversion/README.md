# `Cholesky-based Matrix Inversion` Sample

This `Cholesky-based Matrix Inversion` sample is a reference design that demonstrates the use of Cholesky decomposition and inversion header libraries on 32x32 real matrices:

- `streaming_cholesky.hpp` - linear algebra header library implements the Cholesky decomposition of matrices with pipe interfaces.
- `streaming_cholesky_inversion.hpp` - linear algebra header library implements the inversion of matrices with pipe interfaces, based on the outputs of the cholesky decomposition implemented in `streaming_cholesky.hpp`.

Both the decomposition and the inversion have template parameters that can be set to decompose/invert custom sized real or complex square matrices.

| What you will learn   | How to implement high performance Cholesky matrix decomposition on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
| Time to complete      | ~1 hr (excluding compile time)

## Purpose

This FPGA reference design demonstrates Cholesky-based matrix inversion, a common operation employed in linear algebra, as implemented in supplied header libraries.

The Cholesky decomposition takes a hermitian, positive-definite matrix $A$ (input) and computes the lower triangular matrix $L$ such that:

$LL^{\star} = A$
where $L^{\star}$ in the conjugate transpose of $L$.

Given this decomposition, the inverse of A can be computed as

$A^{-1} = (LL^{\star})^{-1} = (L^{\star})^{-1}L^{-1} = (L^{-1})^{\star} L^{-1}$

Therefore, in order to compute the inverse of A, one can: compute $LI$, the invert of $L$ (triangular matrix) and perform a matrix multiplication of the transpose of $LI$ by $LI$.

$A^{-1} = LI^{\star}LI$

Because $A^{-1}$  is going to be symmetric, one can also compute only half of the values.

## Key Implementation Details

In this reference design, the Cholesky decomposition algorithm is used to factor a real _n_ × _n_ matrix. The algorithm computes the vector dot product of two rows of the matrix. In our FPGA implementation, the dot product is computed in a loop over the row's _n_ elements. The loop is fully unrolled to maximize throughput. As a result, *n* real multiplication operations are performed in parallel on the FPGA, followed by sequential additions to compute the dot product result.

With this optimization, our FPGA implementation requires _n_ DSPs to compute the real floating point dot product. The input matrix is also replicated two times in order to be able to read two full rows per cycle. The matrix size is constrained by the total FPGA DSP and RAM resources available.

The matrix inversion algorithm used in this reference design performs a Gaussian elimination to invert the triangular matrix _L_ obtained by the Cholesky decomposition. To do so, another _n_ DSPs are required to perform the associated dot-product. Finally, the matrix product of $LI^{\star}LI$ also requires _n_ DSPs.

A handful of extra DSPs are required to perform various arithmetic operations such as division, reciprocal square root, among others.

| Kernel                  | Description
|:---                     |:---
| `CholeskyDecomposition` | Implements a modified Cholesky–Banachiewicz decomposition algorithm.
| `CholeskyInversion`     | Implements the matrix inversion based on the CholeskyDecomposition's outputs.

To optimize the performance-critical loops in these algorithms, the design leverages concepts discussed in the following FPGA tutorials:

- **Triangular Loop Optimization** (triangular_loop)
- **Explicit Pipelining with `fpga_reg`** (fpga_register)
- **Loop `ivdep` Attribute** (loop_ivdep)
- **Unrolling Loops** (loop_unroll)

The design uses the following key optimization techniques:
1. Traversing the matrix in a column fashion to increase the read-after-write (RAW) loop iteration distance.
2. Using two copies of the compute matrix in order to be able to read a full row and a full column per cycle.
3. Converting the nested loop into a single merged loop and applying Triangular Loop optimizations. This allows us to generate a design that is very well pipelined.
4. Fully vectorizing the dot products using loop unrolling.
5. Using an efficient memory banking scheme to generate high performance hardware (all local memories are single-read, single-write).
6. Using the `fpga_reg` attribute to insert more pipeline stages where needed to improve the frequency achieved by the design.
7. Using the input matrices properties (hermitian positive matrices) to reduce the number of operations. For example, the (_LI_*) * _LI_ computation only requires to compute half of the output matrix as the result is symmetric.

## Build the `Cholesky-based Matrix Inversion` Program

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

## Run the `Cholesky-based Matrix Inversion` Executable

### Configurable Parameters

| Parameter    | Description
|:---          |:---
| `<num>`      | (Optional) Argument to specify the number of times to repeat the inversion of 8 matrices. Its default value is `16` for the emulation flow and `819200` for the FPGA flow. Pass the parameter as an input value: `<program name> <num>`.

You can apply the Cholesky-based inversion to 8 matrices repeated a number of times optionally passed to the program. This step performs the following:

- Generates 8 random matrices (this number can be changed in cholesky_inversion_demo.cpp).
- Computes the Cholesky-based inversion on all matrices.
- Repeats the operation multiple times (optionally specified as the command line argument) to evaluate performance.
