## Purpose

Due to pointer aliasing, the compiler must be conservative about optimizations that reorder, parallelize or overlap operations that could alias. This tutorial demonstrates the use of the SYCL*-compliant `[[intel::kernel_args_restrict]]` kernel attribute, which should be applied any time you can guarantee that kernel arguments do not alias. This attribute enables more aggressive compiler optimizations and often improves kernel performance on FPGA.

### What Is Pointer Aliasing?

Pointer aliasing occurs when the same memory location can be accessed using different *names* (i.e., variables). For example, consider the code below. Here, the value of the variable `pi` can be changed in three ways: `pi=3.14159`, `*a=3.14159` or `*b=3.14159`. In general, the compiler has to be conservative about which accesses may alias to each other and avoid making optimizations that reorder and/or parallelize operations.

```c++
float pi = 3.14;
float *a = &pi;
float *b = a;
```

### Pointer Aliasing of Arguments

Consider the function illustrated below. Though the intention of the code is clear to the reader, the compiler cannot guarantee that `in` does not alias with `out`. Imagine a degenerate case where the function was called: like this `myCopy(ptr, ptr+1, 10)`. This would cause `in[i]` and `out[i+1]` to alias to the same address, for all `i` from 0 to 9.

```c++
void myCopy(int *in, int *out, size_t int size) {
  for(size_t int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    out[i] = in[i];
  }
}
```

This possibility of aliasing forces the compiler to be conservative. Without more information from the developer, it cannot make any optimizations that overlap, vectorize or reorder the assignment operations. Doing so would result in functionally incorrect behavior if the compiled function is called with aliasing pointers.

If this code is compiled to FPGA, the performance penalty of this conservatism is severe. The loop in `myCopy` cannot be pipelined, because the next iteration of the loop cannot begin until the current iteration has completed.

### A Promise to the Compiler

The developer often knows that pointer arguments will never alias in practice, as with the `myCopy` function. In your program, you can use the `[[intel::kernel_args_restrict]]` attribute to inform the compiler that none of a kernel's arguments will alias to any another, thereby enabling more aggressive optimizations. If the non-aliasing assumption is violated at runtime, the result will be undefined behavior.

C and OpenCL programmers may recognize this concept as the `restrict` keyword.

### Tutorial Code Description

In this tutorial, we will show how to use the `kernel_args_restrict` attribute for your kernel and its effect on performance. We show two kernels that perform the same function; one with and one without `[[intel::kernel_args_restrict]]` being applied to it. The function of the kernel is simple: copy the contents of one buffer to another. We will analyze the effect of the `[[intel::kernel_args_restrict]]` attribute on the kernel's performance by analyzing loop II in the reports and the latency of the kernel on actual hardware.

## Key Concepts

* The problem of *pointer aliasing* and its impact on compiler optimizations.
- The behavior of the `kernel_args_restrict` attribute and when to use it on your kernel.
- The effect this attribute can have on your kernel's performance on FPGA.

## Building the `kernel_args_restrict` Tutorial

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake ..
  ```

  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   - Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

     ```
     make fpga_emu
     ```

   - Generate the optimization report:

     ```
     make report
     ```

   - Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device)

     ```
     make fpga_sim
     ```

   - Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```
     make fpga
     ```

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
  ```
  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   - Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```

   - Generate the optimization report:

     ```
     nmake report
     ```

   - Compile for the simulation target (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device)

     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```

   - Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

## Examining the Reports

Locate `report.html` in the `kernel_args_restrict_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

Navigate to the *Loop Analysis* report (*Throughput Analysis* > *Loop Analysis*). In the *Loop List pane*, you should see two kernels: one is the kernel without the attribute applied (*KernelArgsNoRestrict*) and the other with the attribute applied (*KernelArgsRestrict*). Each kernel has a single for-loop, which appears in the *Loop List* pane. Click on the loop under each kernel to see how the compiler optimized it.

Compare the loop initiation interval (II) between the two kernels. Notice that the loop in the *KernelArgsNoRestrict* kernel has a large estimated II, while the loop in the *KernelArgsRestrict* kernel has an estimated II of ~1. These IIs are estimates because the latency of global memory accesses varies with runtime conditions.

For the *KernelArgsNoRestrict* kernel, the compiler assumed that the kernel arguments can alias each other. Since`out[i]` and `in[i+1]` could be the same memory location, the compiler cannot overlap the iteration of the loop performing `out[i] = in[i]` with the next iteration of the loop performing `out[i+1] = in[i+1]` (and likewise for iterations `in[i+2]`, `in[i+3]`, ...). This results in an II equal to the latency of the global memory read of `in[i]` plus the latency of the global memory write to `out[i]`.

We can confirm this by looking at the details of the loop. Click on the *KernelArgsNoRestrict* kernel in the *Loop List* pane and then click on the loop in the *Loop Analysis* pane. Now consider the *Details* pane below. You should see something like:

- *Compiler failed to schedule this loop with smaller II due to memory dependency*
  - *From: Load Operation (kernel_args_restrict.cpp: 74 > accessor.hpp: 945)*
  - *To: Store Operation (kernel_args_restrict.cpp: 74)*
- *Most critical loop feedback path during scheduling:*
  - *144.00 clock cycles Load Operation (kernel_args_restrict.cpp: 74 > accessor.hpp: 945)*
  - *42.00 clock cycles Store Operation (kernel_args_restrict.cpp: 74)*

The first bullet (and its sub-bullets) tells you that a memory dependency exists between the load and store operations in the loop. This is the conservative pointer aliasing memory dependency described earlier. The second bullet shows you the estimated latencies for the load and store operations (note that these are board-dependent). The sum of these two latencies (plus 1) is the II of the loop.

Next, look at the loop details of the *KernelArgsRestrict* kernel. You will notice that the *Details* pane doesn't show a memory dependency. The usage of the `[[intel::kernel_args_restrict]]` attribute allowed the compiler to schedule a new iteration of the for-loop every cycle since it knows that accesses to `in` and `out` will never alias.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):

     ```bash
     ./kernel_args_restrict.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     kernel_args_restrict.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device:

    * On Linux
        ```bash
        CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./kernel_args_restrict.fpga_sim
        ```
    * On Windows
        ```bash
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
        kernel_args_restrict.fpga_sim.exe
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
        ```

3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`):

     ```bash
     ./kernel_args_restrict.fpga         (Linux)
     kernel_args_restrict.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```

### Example of Output

```bash
Kernel throughput without attribute: 8.06761 MB/s
Kernel throughput with attribute: 766.873 MB/s
PASSED
```

### Discussion of Results

The throughput observed when running the kernels with and without the `kernel_args_restrict` attribute should reflect the difference in loop II seen in the reports. The ratios will not exactly match because the loop IIs are estimates. An example ratio (compiled and run on the Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card (PAC) with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA) is shown.

|Attribute used?  | II | Kernel Throughput (MB/s)
|:--- |:--- |:---
|No  | ~187 | 8
|Yes  | ~1 | 767

> **Note**: This performance difference will be apparent only when running on FPGA hardware. The emulator and simulator, while useful for verifying functionality, will generally not reflect differences in performance of the memory system.
