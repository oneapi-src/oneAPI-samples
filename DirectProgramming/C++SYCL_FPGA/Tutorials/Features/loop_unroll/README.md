## Purpose

The loop unrolling mechanism is used to increase program parallelism by duplicating the compute logic within a loop. The number of times the loop logic is duplicated is called the *unroll factor*. Depending on whether the *unroll factor* is equal to the number of loop iterations or not, loop unroll methods can be categorized as *full-loop unrolling* and *partial-loop unrolling*.

### Example: Full-Loop Unrolling
```c++
// Before unrolling loop
#pragma unroll
for(i = 0 ; i < 5; i++){
  a[i] += 1;
}

// Equivalent code after unrolling
// There is no longer any loop
a[0] += 1;
a[1] += 1;
a[2] += 1;
a[3] += 1;
a[4] += 1;
```
A full unroll is a special case where the unroll factor is equal to the number of loop iterations. Here, the compiler instantiates five adders instead of one adder.

### Example: Partial-Loop Unrolling

```c++
// Before unrolling loop
#pragma unroll 4
for(i = 0 ; i < 20; i++){
  a[i] += 1;
}

// Equivalent code after unrolling by a factor of 4
// The resulting loop has five (20 / 4) iterations
for(i = 0 ; i < 5; i++){
  a[i * 4] += 1;
  a[i * 4 + 1] += 1;
  a[i * 4 + 2] += 1;
  a[i * 4 + 3] += 1;
}
```
Each loop iteration in the "equivalent code" contains four unrolled invocations of the first. The compiler instantiates four adders instead of one adder. Because there is no data dependency between iterations in the loop, the compiler schedules all four adds in parallel.

### Determining the optimal unroll factor
In an FPGA design, unrolling loops is a common strategy to directly trade off on-chip resources for increased throughput. When selecting the unroll factor for a specific loop, the intent is to improve throughput while minimizing resource utilization. It is also important to be mindful of other throughput constraints in your system, such as memory bandwidth.

### Tutorial design
This tutorial demonstrates this trade-off with a simple vector add kernel. The tutorial shows how increasing the unroll factor on a loop increases throughput... until another bottleneck is encountered. This example is constructed to run up against global memory bandwidth constraints.

For this examples, lets consider the Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA. The memory bandwidth of this FPGA board is about 6 GB/s. The tutorial design will likely run at around 300 MHz when targeting this BSP. In this design, the FPGA design processes a new iteration every cycle in a pipeline-parallel fashion. The theoretical computation limit for one adder is:

**GFlops**: 300 MHz \* 1 float = 0.3 GFlops

**Computation Bandwidth**: 300 MHz \* 1 float * 4 Bytes   = 1.2 GB/s

You repeat this back-of-the-envelope calculation for different unroll factors:

|Unroll Factor  | GFlops (GB/s) | Computation Bandwidth (GB/s)
|:---           |:---           |:---
|1              | 0.3           | 1.2
|2              | 0.6           | 2.4
|4              | 1.2           | 4.8
|8              | 2.4           | 9.6
|16             | 4.8           | 19.2

On an Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, it is reasonable to predict that this program will become memory-bandwidth limited when the unroll factor grows from 4 to 8. If you have access to such an FPGA board, check this prediction by running the design following the instructions below, providing the appropriate BSP when running `cmake`.

* How to unroll loops in your program.
* Determining the optimal unroll factor for your program.

## Building the `loop_unroll` Tutorial

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake ..
  ```

  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga_emu
     ```
   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulator FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga_sim
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
  ```
  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulator FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `loop_unroll_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

Navigate to the Area Report and compare the kernels' FPGA resource utilization with unroll factors of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. In particular, check the number of DSP resources consumed. You should see the area grows roughly linearly with the unroll factor.

You can also check the achieved system f<sub>MAX</sub> to verify the earlier calculations.

## Running the Sample

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./loop_unroll.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     loop_unroll.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device:
  * On Linux
    ```bash
    CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./loop_unroll.fpga_sim
    ```
  * On Windows
    ```bash
    set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
    loop_unroll.fpga_sim.exe
    set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
    ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`):
     ```
     ./loop_unroll.fpga         (Linux)
     loop_unroll.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```

PASSED: The results are correct
```

### Discussion of Results
The following table summarizes the execution time (in ms), throughput (in GFlops), and number of DSPs used for unroll factors of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 for a default input array size of 64M floats (2 ^ 26 floats) on Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel® Arria® 10 GX FPGA:

Unroll Factor  | Kernel Time (ms) | Throughput (GFlops) | Num of DSPs
|:---          |:---              |:---                 |:---
|1             | 242              | 0.277               | 1
|2             | 127              | 0.528               | 2
|4             | 63               | 1.065               | 4
|8             | 46               | 1.459               | 8
|16            | 44               | 1.525               | 16

Notice that when the unroll factor increases from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 4, the kernel execution time decreases by a factor of two. Correspondingly, the kernel throughput doubles. However, when the unroll factor is increased from 4 to 8 or from 8 to 16, the throughput no longer scales by a factor of two at each step. The design is now bound by memory bandwidth limitations instead of compute unit limitations, even though the hardware is replicated.

These performance differences will be apparent only when running on FPGA hardware. The emulator, while useful for verifying functionality, will generally not reflect differences in performance.
