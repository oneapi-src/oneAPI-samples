## Purpose

This tutorial shows how to apply global and local controls to set the implementation preference between DSPs and soft-logic for certain math operations. The global control is applied using a command-line flag and affects applicable math operations in all kernels. The local control is applied as a library function and affects math operations in a block scope in a single kernel. Both global and local controls only affect math operations that support DSP control (see table below).

| Software             | Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler

> **Note**: Even though the Intel DPC++/C++ OneAPI compiler is enough to compile for emulation, generating reports and generating RTL, there are extra software requirements for the simulation flow and FPGA compiles.
>
> For using the simulator flow, Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition (or Standard Edition when targeting Cyclone® V) and one of the following simulators must be installed and accessible through your PATH:
> - Questa*-Intel® FPGA Edition
> - Questa*-Intel® FPGA Starter Edition
> - ModelSim® SE
>
> When using the hardware compile flow, Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition (or Standard Edition when targeting Cyclone® V) must be installed and accessible through your PATH.

> **Warning** Make sure you add the device files associated with the FPGA that you are targeting to your Intel® Quartus® Prime installation.

> **Warning** Although this sample will compile when targeting a Cyclone® V FPGA, the DSP controls will be ignored as this feature is not supported on this FPGA family.

This sample is part of the FPGA code samples.
It is categorized as a Tier 3 sample that demonstrates a compiler feature.

## Key Implementation Details

The sample illustrates these important concepts.

- Scope of data types and math operations that support DSP control.
- How to apply global DSP control from the command-line.
- How to apply local DSP control in source code.

### Scope of Data Types and Math Operations

| Datatype           | Controllable Math Operations
|:---                |:---
| `float`            | addition, subtraction, multiplication
| `ap_float<8, 23>`  | addition, subtraction, multiplication
| `int`              | multiplication
| `ac_int`           | multiplication
| `ac_fixed`         | multiplication

### Global Control

The `-Xsdsp-mode=<option>` command-line flag sets implementation preference of math operations that support DSP control in all kernels. It has three valid options:

| Option             | Explanation
|:---                |:---
| `default`          | This is the default option if this command-line flag is not passed manually. The compiler determines the implementation based on datatype and math operation.
| `prefer-dsp`       | Prefer math operations to be implemented in **DSPs**. If a math operation is implemented by DSPs by default, you will see no difference in resource utilization or area. Otherwise, you will notice a decrease in the usage of soft-logic resources and an increase in the usage of DSPs.
| `prefer-softlogic` | Prefer math operations to be implemented in **soft-logic**. If a math operation is implemented without DSPs by default, you will see no difference in resource utilization or area. Otherwise, you will notice a decrease in the usage of DSPs and an increase in the usage of soft-logic resources.

### Local Control

The library function `math_dsp_control<Preference::<enum>, Propagate::<enum>>([&]{})` provides block scope local control in one single kernel. A reference-capturing lambda expression is passed as the argument to this library function. Inside the lambda expression, implementation preference of math operations that support DSP control will be determined by two template arguments.

The first template argument `Preference::<option>` is an enum with three valid options:

| Option               | Explanation
|:---                  |:---
| `DSP`                | Prefer math operations to be implemented in **DSPs**. Its behavior on a math operation is equivalent to global control `-Xsdsp-mode=prefer-dsp`. <br> **NOTE:** This option will be automatically applied if the template argument `Preference` is not specified manually.
| `Softlogic`          | Prefer math operations to be implemented in **soft-logic**. Its behavior on a math operation is equivalent to global control `-Xsdsp-mode=prefer-softlogic`.
| `Compiler_default`   | Compiler determines the implementation based on datatype and math operation. Its behavior on a math operation is equivalent to global control `-Xsdsp-mode=default`.

The second template argument `Propagate::<option>` is an enum that determines whether the DSP control applies to controllable math operations in function calls inside the lambda expression:

| Option               | Explanation
|:---                  |:---
| `On`                 | DSP control recursively applies to controllable math operations in all function calls inside the lambda expression. <br> **NOTE:** This option will be automatically applied if the template argument `Propagate` is not specified manually.
| `Off`                | DSP control only applies to controllable math operations directly inside the lambda expression. Math operations in function calls inside the lambda expression are not affected by this DSP control.

>**Note**: A nested `math_dsp_control<>()` call is only controlled by its own `Preference`. The `Preference` of the parent `math_dsp_control<>()` does not affect the nested `math_dsp_control<>()`, even if the parent has `Propagate::On`. Additionally, local control overrides global control on a controlled math operation.

## Build the `DSP Control` Tutorial

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulates an FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the HTML optimization reports. (See [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for information on finding and understanding the reports.)
      ```
      make report
      ```
   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile and run on FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets an FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga
      ```

### On Windows*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for the Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the optimization report. (See [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for information on finding and understanding the reports.)
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced problem size).
      ```
      nmake fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```
> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
### Read the Reports
