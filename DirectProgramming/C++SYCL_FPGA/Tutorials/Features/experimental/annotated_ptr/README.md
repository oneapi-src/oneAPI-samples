## Purpose

The [hls_flow_interfaces/mmhost](/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/Tutorials/Features/hls_flow_interfaces/mmhost) code sample demonstrates how to use the `annotated_arg` wrapper class to customize an Avalon memory-mapped interface for an FPGA IP component.

A useful design optimization in FPGA SYCL code is to design with multiple buffer locations, (either multiple memory channels in a full SYCL system, or multiple memory-mapped host interfaces in a SYCL HLS IP). If your code contains un-annotated pointers (e.g. `float *`), the compiler will not know at compile time which buffer location to assign to load/store units (LSUs) associated with that pointer. This tutorial shows how to use the `annotated_ptr` class to constrain memory accesses to a pointer variable inside the kernel, which reduces the number of LSUs used in the generated FPGA IP component.

### An FPGA Component That Contains Memory Access to an Ambiguous Buffer Location
In the example, the device code defines a SYCL kernel functor that computes the dot product between a weight matrix (located in buffer location 1) and a vector (located in buffer location 2), and saves to the result vector (located in buffer location 1).

![](assets/interfaces.svg)

The input and output vectors are kernel arguments passed by the host and annotated with `annotated_arg`:
```c++
struct DotProductIP {
  annotated_arg<float *, decltype(properties{buffer_location<kBL2>})> in_vec;
  annotated_arg<float *, decltype(properties{buffer_location<kBL1>})> out_vec;
  ...
};
```

The address to each row of the weight matrix is transferred into the kernel via a host pipe. The kernel reads the row pointers of the weight matrix and then performs the dot product operation.
```c++
using Pipe2DotProductIP = ext::intel::experimental::pipe<class MyPipeName1, float *>;
...
float *p = MyPipe::read();

float sum = 0.0f;
#pragma unroll COLS
for (int j = 0; j < COLS; j++)
   sum += p[j] * in_vec[j];
out_vec[i] = sum;
```

The global memory access of the kernel is distributed as follows
- `p[j]`: buffer location is ambiguous because `p` is simply a `float *` without any annotations telling the compiler which buffer location it should be assigned to. So the compiler will generate load units connected to buffer location 1 **and** load units connected to buffer location 2. This is illustrated in the FPGA report, see [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for more details.
- `in_vec[j]`: The compiler knows this accesses buffer location 2 because `in_vec` is an annotated kernel argument.
- `out_vec[j]`: The compiler knows this accesses buffer location 1 because `out_vec` is an annotated kernel argument.

### Use the `annotated_ptr` Class to Constrain the Memory Access
You can provide the buffer location information of `p` to the compiler by wrapping it in an `annotated_ptr`, and then use the `annotated_ptr` local variable in the dot-product computation
```c++
annotated_ptr<float, decltype(properties{buffer_location<1>})> mat{p};

float sum = 0.0f;
#pragma unroll COLS
for (int j = 0; j < COLS; j++)
   sum += mat[j] * in_vec[j];
out_vec[i] = sum;
```

Now all the global memory accesses are assigned to a specific buffer location, including `p`, which is located in buffer location 1. This removes half of the load units connected to buffer location 2, saving significant FPGA resources.

> [!WARNING]
> The buffer location that is passed to `annotated_ptr` must be one of the buffer locations already assigned to global memory kernel arguments (in this case, buffer location `kBL1` and `kBL2`).

> [!WARNING]
> The `annotated_ptr` class does not currently support the `alignment` property. Therefore, the consecutive memory accesses via the pointer `mat` in the unrolled loop cannot be configured to generate a statically coalesced load unit.

## Building the `annotated_ptr` Tutorial
> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

Use these commands to run the design, depending on your OS.

### On a Linux* System
This design uses CMake to generate a build script for GNU/make.

1. Change to the sample directory.

2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

3. Compile the design with the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

	| Compilation Type    | Command
	|:---                 |:---
	| FPGA Emulator       | `make fpga_emu`
	| Optimization Report | `make report`
	| FPGA Simulator      | `make fpga_sim`
	| FPGA Hardware       | `make fpga`

### On a Windows* System
This design uses CMake to generate a build script for  `nmake`.

1. Change to the sample directory.

2. Configure the build system for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   
3. Compile the design with the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

	| Compilation Type    | Command (Windows)
	|:---                 |:---
	| FPGA Emulator       | `nmake fpga_emu`
	| Optimization Report | `nmake report`
	| FPGA Simulator      | `nmake fpga_sim`
	| FPGA Hardware       | `nmake fpga`


### Read the Reports

Build the `report` target and locate `report.html` in the `annotated_ptr.report.prj/reports/` directory.

Navigate to *System Viewer* (*Views* > *System Viewer*) and click on the *AnnotatedPtrIP* kernel in the *System* hierarchy. Observe that the compiler generates a number of `COLS` LD nodes connected to global memory 1, which correspond to `COLS` times of read access over annotated_ptr `mat` in the inner loop of the computation.

![](assets/annotation.png)

By clicking on the *DotProductIP* kernel, you can verify that using the unannotated pointer `p` in the inner loop of dot product will result in an additional number of `COLS` LD nodes generated and connected to global memory 2, and thereby an increase in the *Area Estimates* tab.
