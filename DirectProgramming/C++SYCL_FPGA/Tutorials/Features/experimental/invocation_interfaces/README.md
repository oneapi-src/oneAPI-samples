## Purpose

Use register map and streaming interface annotations to specify how the kernel invocation handshaking is performed, as well as how the kernel argument data is passed in to the kernel.

## Understanding Register Map and Streaming Interfaces

The kernel invocation interface (namely, the `start` and `done` signals) can be implemented in the kernel's CSR, or using a ready/valid handshake. Similarly, the kernel arguments can be passed through the CSR, or through dedicated conduits. The invocation interface and any argument interfaces are specified independently, so you may choose to implement the invocation interface with a ready/valid handshake, and implement the kernel arguments in the CSR. All argument interfaces that are implemented as conduits will be synchronized to the ready/valid handshake of the kernel invocation interface. This means that it is not possible to configure a kernel with a register-mapped invocation interface and conduit arguments. The following table lists valid kernel argument interface synchronizations.

| Invocation Interface    | Argument Interface    | Argument Interface Synchronization        |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Streaming               | Streaming             | Synchronized with `start` and `ready_out` |
| Streaming               | Register mapped       | N/A                                       |
| Register mapped         | Streaming             | *No synchronization possible*             |
| Register mapped         | Register mapped       | N/A                                       |

> **Note**: Register mapped kernel arguments are not currently supported in kernels with a streaming invocation interface.

If you would like an argument to have its own dedicated ready/valid handshake, please implement that argument using a [Host Pipe](../hostpipes/).

:warning: The register map and streaming interface feature is only supported in the IP Authoring flow. The IP Authoring flow compiles SYCL* source code to standalone IPs that can be deployed into your Intel® Quartus® Prime projects. Emulator and simulator executables are still generated to allow you to validate your IP. You can run the generated HDL through Intel® Quartus® Prime to generate accurate f<sub>MAX</sub> and area estimates. However, the FPGA executables generated in this tutorial is ***not*** supported to be run on FPGA devices directly.

### Declaring a register map kernel interface

#### Example Functor

```c++
struct MyIP {
  MyIP() {}
  register_map_interface void operator()() const {
    ...
  }
};
```

#### Example Lambda
```c++
q.single_task([=] register_map_interface {
  ...
})
```

### Declaring a streaming kernel interface

#### Example Functor

```c++
struct MyIP {
  MyIP() {}
  streaming_interface void operator()() const {
    ...
  }
};
```

#### Example Lambda
```c++
q.single_task([=] streaming_interface {
  ...
})
```

### Declaring a register map kernel argument interface

#### Example Functor

```c++
struct MyIP {
  register_map int arg1;
  register_map_interface void operator()() const {
    ...
  }
};
```

*__Note__:* Register mapped kernel arguments are not currently supported in kernels with a streaming invocation interface.

### Declaring a streaming kernel argument interface

```c++
struct MyIP {
  conduit int arg1;
  register_map_interface void operator()() const {
    ...
  }
};
```

### Default Interfaces
If no annotation is specified for the kernel invocation interface, then a register map kernel invocation interface will be inferred by the compiler. If no annotation is specified for the a kernel argument, then that kernel argument will have the same interface as the kernel invocation interface. In the Lambda programming model, all kernel arguments will have the same interface as the kernel invocation interface.

### Testing the Tutorial
A total of four sources files are in the `src/` directory, declaring a total of four kernels. Two use the functor programming model, and the other use the lambda programming model. For each programming model, one kernel is declared with the register map kernel invocation interface and the other kernel is declared with the streaming kernel invocation interface.

```c++
struct FunctorRegisterMapIP {
  register_map ValueT *input;
  ValueT *output;
  conduit size_t n;
  register_map_interface void operator()() const {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      output[i] = SomethingComplicated(input[i]);
    }
  }
};
```
```c++
struct FunctorStreamingIP {
  conduit ValueT *input;
  conduit ValueT *output;
  size_t n;
  streaming_interface void operator()() const {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      output[i] = SomethingComplicated(input[i]);
    }
  }
};
```

These two functor kernels are invoked in the same way in the host code, by constructing the struct and submitting a `single_task` into the SYCL `queue`.

```c++
q.single_task(FunctorRegisterMapIP{in, functor_register_map_out, count}).wait();
```
```c++
q.single_task(FunctorStreamingIP{in, functor_streaming_out, count}).wait();
```

The two lambda kernels are annotated directly on the lambda function body and submitted into the SYCL `queue` as a `single_task`.

```c++
void TestLambdaRegisterMapKernel(sycl::queue &q, ValueT *in, ValueT *out, size_t count) {
  q.single_task<LambdaRegisterMapIP>([=] register_map_interface  {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      out[i] = SomethingComplicated(in[i]);
    }
  }).wait();
}
```
```c++
void TestLambdaStreamingKernel(sycl::queue &q, ValueT *in, ValueT *out, size_t count) {
  q.single_task<LambdaStreamingIP>([=] streaming_interface  {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
      out[i] = SomethingComplicated(in[i]);
    }
  }).wait();
}
```

## Key Concepts
* Basics of declaring kernel invocation interfaces and kernel argument interfaces

## Building the `invocation_interfaces` Tutorial

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

## Examining the Reports

Locate `report.html` in the corresponding `<source_file>_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in any of the following web browsers:  Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

Open the **Views** menu and select **System Viewer**.

In the left-hand pane, select **FunctorRegisterMapIP** or **LambdaRegisterMapIP** under the System hierarchy for the kernels with a register-mapped invocation interface.

In the main **System Viewer** pane, the kernel invocation interfaces and kernel argument interfaces are shown. They show that the `start`, `busy` and `done` kernel invocation interfaces are implemented in register map interfaces, the `arg_input` and `arg_output` kernel arguments are implemented in register map interfaces. The `arg_n` kernel argument is implemented in a streaming interface in the **FunctorRegisterMapIP**, and in a register map interface in the **LambdaRegisterMapIP**.

Similarly, in the left-hand pane, select **FunctorStreamingIP** or **LambdaStreamingIP** under the System hierarchy for the kernels with a streaming invocation interface.

In the main **System Viewer** pane, the kernel invocation interface and kernel argument interfaces are shown. They show that the `start`, `done`, `ready_in` and `ready_out` kernel invocation interfaces are implemented in streaming interfaces, and the `arg_input`, `arg_output` and `arg_n` kernel arguments are all implemented in streaming interfaces.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./register_map_functor_model.fpga_emu        (Linux)

     CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./streaming_lambda_model.fpga_sim
     ```
  * On Windows
     ```bash
    set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
     register_map_functor_model.fpga_sim.exe

### Example Simulation Waveform

The diagram below shows the example waveform generated by the simulator that you will see for the kernels with a register-mapped invocation interface. The waveform shows the register-mapped kernel arguments and kernel invocation handshaking signals are passed in through an Avalon agent interface, whose addresses are as specified in the agent memory map header files in the project directory.

The diagram below shows the example waveform generated by the simulator that you will see for the kernels with a streaming invocation interface. The waveform shows the streaming kernel arguments and kernel invocation handshaking signals follow the Avalon-ST protocol. The streaming invocation interface consumes the kernel arguments on the clock cycle that the `start` and `ready_out` signals are asserted, and the kernel invocation is finished on the clock cycle that the `done` and `ready_in` signals are asserted.
