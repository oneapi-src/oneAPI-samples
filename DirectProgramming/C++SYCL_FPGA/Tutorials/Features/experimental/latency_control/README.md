## Purpose

This FPGA tutorial demonstrates how to set latency constraints to pipes and LSUs accesses and how to confirm that the compiler respected the latency control directive.

### Use Model

> __Note__: The APIs described in this section are experimental. Future versions of latency controls might change these APIs in ways that are incompatible with the version described here.

Latency controls APIs are provided on member functions `read()` and `write()` of class `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::pipe` and on member functions `load()` and `store()` of class `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::lsu`. Other than the latency controls support, the experimental `pipe` and `lsu` are identical to `sycl::ext::intel::pipe` and `sycl::ext::intel::lsu`. The experimental `pipe` and `lsu` are also provided by `<sycl/ext/intel/fpga_extensions.hpp>`.

These `read()`, `write()`, `load()`, and `store()` member functions can take a property list instance (`sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties`) as a function argument, which can contain the following latency controls properties:

* `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_anchor_id<N>`, where `N` is a signed integer

   A label that can be associated with the pipes and LSUs functions listed above. This label can then be referenced by the `latency_constraint` properties to define relative latency constraints. Functions with this property will be referred to as "labeled functions".

* `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_constraint<A, B, C>`

    A constraint then can be associated with the pipes and LSUs functions listed above. It provides a latency constraint between this function and a different labeled function. Functions which have this property will be referred to as "constrained functions". This constraint has  the following parameters:

  * `A` is a signed integer: The label of the labeled function which is constrained relative to the constrained function.
  * `B` is an enum value: The type of constraint, can be `latency_control_type::exact` (exact latency), `latency_control_type::max` (maximum latency), and `latency_control_type::min` (minimum latency).
  * `C` is a signed integer: The relative clock cycle difference between the labeled function and the constrained function, that the constraint should infer subject to the type of constraint (exact/max/main).

### Simple Code Example

The following example shows you how to use latency controls on pipes. The example also uses a function acting as both labeled function and constrained function:

```cpp
using Pipe1 = sycl::ext::intel::experimental::pipe<class PipeClass1, int, 8>;
using Pipe2 = sycl::ext::intel::experimental::pipe<class PipeClass2, int, 8>;
using Pipe3 = sycl::ext::intel::experimental::pipe<class PipeClass2, int, 8>;
...
// In kernel:
// The following read has a label 0.
int value = Pipe1::read(sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties(
    sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_anchor_id<0>));

// The following write occurs exactly 2 cycles after the label-0 function, i.e.,
// the read above. Also, it has a label 1.
Pipe2::write(
    value,
    sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties(
        sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_anchor_id<1>,
        sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_constraint<
            0, sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_control_type::exact,
            2>));

// The following write occurs at least 2 cycles after the label-1 function,
// i.e., the write above.
Pipe3::write(
    value,
    sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties(
        sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_constraint<
            1, sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_control_type::min, 2>));
```

This next example shows you how to use latency controls on LSUs. It also uses a negative relative cycle number in `latency_constraint`, which means that the constrained function is scheduled __before__ the associated labeled function:

```cpp
using BurstCoalescedLSU = sycl::ext::intel::experimental::lsu<
    sycl::ext::intel::experimental::burst_coalesce<false>,
    sycl::ext::intel::experimental::statically_coalesce<false>>;
...
// In kernel:
// The following load occurs at most 5 cycles before the label-2 function,
// i.e., the store below.
int value = BurstCoalescedLSU::load(
    input_ptr,
    sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties(
        sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_constraint<
            2, sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_control_type::max, -5>));

// The following store has a label 2.
BurstCoalescedLSU::store(
    output_ptr, value,
    sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties(
        sycl::ext::intel::experimental::latency_anchor_id<2>));
```

### Rules and Limitations

* `latency_anchor_id` must be non-negative
* `latency_anchor_id` must be a unique number within the whole design
* The labeled function and the constrained function of a constraint must meet one of the following conditions:
  * Both are in the same block but not in any cluster
  * Both are in the same cluster

> __Note__: Clusters can be identified in the System Viewer (__Views > System Viewer__) of the `report.html` report.

The compiler tries to achieve the latency constraints, and it errors out if some constraints cannot be satisfied. For example, if one constraint specifies function A should be scheduled after function B, while another constraint specifies function B should be scheduled after function A, then that set of constraints is unsatisfiable.

## Key Concepts

* How to set latency constraints to pipes and LSUs accesses.
* How to confirm that the compiler respected the latency control directive.

## Building the `latency_control` Tutorial

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake ..
  ```

  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```

   * Generate the optimization report:

     ```
     make report
     ```

   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device)

     ```bash
     make fpga_sim
     ```

   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```
     make fpga
     ```

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
  ```
  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```

   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced problem size):

     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```

   * Generate the optimization report:

     ```
     nmake report
     ```

   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> __Note__: If you encounter any issues with long paths when
compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a
shorter path, for example c:\samples\build. You can then run cmake from that
directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

## Examining the Reports

Locate `report.html` in the `latency_control_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in any of Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

1. Navigate to Schedule Viewer (__Views > Schedule Viewer__). In this view, you can find the load and the store that have latency constraint and then you can check the scheduled latency between them. The scheduled latency should reflect the applied latency control in the design source code. You can also verify the latency control parameters in the __Details__ pane for the load and store nodes.

2. Navigate to System Viewer (__Views > System Viewer__). In this view, you can verify the latency control parameters in the __Details__ pane for the load and the store nodes. You can find the load and store nodes in __LatencyControl.B1__.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):

     ```
     ./latency_control.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     latency_control.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device:

    * On Linux
        ```bash
        CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./latency_control.fpga_sim
        ```
    * On Windows
        ```bash
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
        latency_control.fpga_sim.exe
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
        ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`):

     ```
     ./latency_control.fpga         (Linux)
     latency_control.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```
