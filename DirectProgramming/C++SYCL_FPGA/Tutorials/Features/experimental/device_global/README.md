## Purpose
This tutorial demonstrates a simple example of initializing a `device_global` class to a non-zero value, and using it to keep state between multiple re-launches of a kernel.

### Description of `device_global`
The `device_global` class is an extension that introduces device scoped memory allocations into SYCL that can be accessed within a kernel using syntax similar to C++ global variables, but that have unique instances per `sycl::device`. Similar to C++ global variables, a `device_global` variable have a namespace scope and is visible to all kernels within that scope.

A `device_global` class is instantiated from a class template. The template is parameterized by the type of the underlying allocation, and a list of properties. The type of the allocation also encodes the size of the allocation for potentially multidimensional array types. The list of properties change the functional behavior of the `device_global` instance to enable compiler and runtime optimizations. In the code sample two properties are used, `device_image_scope` and `host_access_none`. The `device_image_scope` property limits the scope of a single instance of a `device_global` from a device to a `device_image`. The absence of the `device_image_scope` property is currently not supported by the compiler. The `host_access` property is an assertion by the user telling the implementation whether the host code copies to or from the `device_global`. The property comes in four variants `host_access_none`, `host_access_read`, `host_access_write`, and `host_access_read_write`(the default), but only the `host_access_none` is supported currently. Further details on these and other properties can be found in the [Properties for `device_global` variables](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/extensions/proposed/sycl_ext_oneapi_device_global.asciidoc#properties-for-device-global-variables) section of the [SYCL `device_global` Language Specification](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/extensions/proposed/sycl_ext_oneapi_device_global.asciidoc)

A `device_global` instance can be used to store state across multiple relaunches of a kernel without having to pass in a `buffer` as a kernel argument. An example of an application that would benefit from such a state is where kernels are nodes in a state-machine.

### How to initialize a `device_global` instance
A `device_global` instance is always zero-initialized. If you need the first usage of a `device_global` instance in device code to be initialized to a non-zero value, use the following technique:

> Instantiate a second `device_global<bool>` that represents a flag that controls when to initialize the `device_global` to a non-zero value. This flag is zero-initialized to `false`. Once initialization happens, the flag is set to `true` and initialization code doesn't execute on subsequent relaunches of the kernel.
```cpp
namespace exp = sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental;
using FPGAProperties = decltype(exp::properties(
    exp::device_image_scope, exp::host_access_none));
exp::device_global<int, FPGAProperties> val;
exp::device_global<bool, FPGAProperties> is_val_initialized;
int main () {
  sycl::queue q;
  q.submit([&](sycl::handler& h) {
    h.single_task([=] {
      // Initialization happens only once
      if (!is_val_initialized) {
        val.get() = 42;
        is_val_initialized.get() = true;
      }
      // uses of `val`
    });
  });
}
```

### Additional Documentation
- [SYCL `device_global` Language Specification](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/extensions/proposed/sycl_ext_oneapi_device_global.asciidoc) helps understand the API and of `device_globals` and restrictions on it's usage

## Key Concepts
* The basic usage of the `device_global` class
* How initialize a `device_global` to non-zero value

## Building the `device_global` Tutorial
> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake ..
  ```

  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced data size):
     ```
     make fpga_sim
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
  ```
  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced data size):
     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./device_global.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     device_global.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device:
    * On Linux
        ```bash
        CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./device_global.fpga_sim
        ```
    * On Windows
        ```bash
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
        device_global.fpga_sim.exe
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
        ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`):
     ```
     ./device_global.fpga         (Linux)
     device_global.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```
