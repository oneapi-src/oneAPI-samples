## Purpose

Loop speculation is an advanced loop pipelining optimization technique. It enables loop iterations to be initiated before determining whether they should have been initiated. Speculated iterations are those iterations that launch before the exit condition computation has completed. This is beneficial when the computation of the exit condition is preventing effective loop pipelining.

The `speculated_iterations` attribute is a loop attribute that enables you to directly control the number of speculated iterations for a loop.  The attribute  `[[intelfpga::speculated_iterations(N)]]` takes an integer argument `N` to specify the permissible number of iterations to speculate.

## Key Implementation Details

The sample illustrates the following important concepts.

- Description of the `speculated_iterations` attribute.
- How to apply the `speculated_iterations` attribute to loops in your program.
- Optimizing the number of speculated iterations.

### Simple Example

```c++
  [[intelfpga::speculated_iterations(1)]]
  while (sycl::log10(x) < N) {
      x += 1;
  }
  dst[0] = x;
```
The loop in this example will have one speculated iteration.

### Operations with Side Effects

When launching speculated iterations, operations with side-effects (such as stores to memory) must be predicated by the exit condition to ensure functional correctness. For this reason, operations with side-effects must be scheduled until after the exit condition has been computed.

### Optimizing the Number of Speculated Iterations

Loop speculation is beneficial when the computation of the loop exit condition is the bottleneck preventing the compiler from achieving a smaller initiation interval (II). In such instances, increasing the number of speculated iterations often improves the II.  Note that this may also uncover additional bottlenecks preventing the further optimization of the loop.

However, adding speculated iterations is not without cost. They introduce overhead in nested loops, reducing overall loop occupancy. Consider the code snippet below:

```c++
for (size_t i = 0; i < kMany; ++i) {
  // The compiler may automatically infer speculated iterations
  for (size_t j = 0; complex_exit_condition(j); ++j) {
    output[i,j] = some_function(input[i,j]);
  }
}
```
The *i+1*th invocation of the inner loop cannot begin until all real and speculated iterations of its *i*th invocation have completed. This overhead is negligible if the number of speculated iterations is much less than the number of real iterations. However, when the inner loop's trip count is small on average, the overhead becomes non-negligible, and the speculated iterations can become detrimental to throughput. In such circumstances, the `speculated_iterations` attribute can be used to *reduce* the number of speculated iterations chosen by the compiler's heuristics.

In both increasing and decreasing cases, some experimentation is usually necessary. Choosing too few speculated iterations could increase the II because multiple cycles are required to evaluate the exit condition. Choosing too many speculated iterations creates unneeded "dead space" between sequential invocations of an inner loop.

### Tutorial Example

In the tutorial design's kernel, the loop's exit condition involves a logarithm and a compare operation. This complex exit condition prevents the loop from achieving ```II=1```.

The design enqueues variants of the kernel with 0, 10, and 27 speculated iterations, respectively, to demonstrate the effect of the `speculated_iterations` attribute on an Intel® Arria® 10 FPGA. Different numbers are chosen for the Intel® Stratix® 10 and Intel Agilex® 7 targets accordingly.

## Build the `Speculated Iterations` Tutorial

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see *[Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html)* or *[Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html)*.

   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
## Read the Reports

Locate `report.html` in the `speculated_iterations_report.prj/reports/` directory.

In the "Loop Analysis" section of the report, check the II of the loop in each kernel version. Use the kernel with 0 speculated iteration as a base version, check its loop II as a hint for the ideal number for speculated iterations. The information shown below is from compiling on Agilex7.

- When the number of `speculated iterations` is set to 0, loop II is 39.
- Setting the `speculated iterations` to 50 yielded an II of 1.
- Setting the `speculated iterations` to an intermediate value of 10 results in an II of 4.

These results make sense when you recall that the loop exit computation has a latency of 39 cycles (suggested by looking at loop II with 0 speculation). With no speculation, a new iteration can only be launched every 39 cycles. Increasing the speculation to 50 enables a new iteration to launch every cycle. Reducing the speculation to 10 results in an II of 4 because 10 speculated iterations multiplied by 4 cycles between iterations leave 40 cycles in which to compute the exit condition, sufficient to cover the 39-cycle exit condition.
