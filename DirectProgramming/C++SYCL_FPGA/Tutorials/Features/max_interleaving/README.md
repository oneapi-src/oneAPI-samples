## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates a method to reduce the area usage of inner loops by disabling interleaved execution. 

When possible, the compiler will generate loop datapaths that enable multiple invocations of the same loop to execute simultaneously, called interleaving, in order to maximize throughput when II is greater than 1. 

Though the extra hardware generated is usually minor, disabling interleaving is an easy way to save area, for example, in non performance-critical paths.

The `[[intel::max_interleaving(0 or 1)]]` attribute can instruct the compiler to limit allocation of these hardware resources in these cases.

## Key Implementation Details

The sample illustrates the following important concepts.

- The basic usage of the `max_interleaving` attribute.
- How the `max_interleaving` attribute affects loop throughput and resource use.
- How to apply the `max_interleaving` attribute to loops in your program.

### Description of the `max_interleaving` Attribute

#### Quick Reference
Place the `[[intel::max_interleaving(0 or 1)]]` attribute above a loop that you want to control interleaving. A parameter of `0` (the default if the attribute is not used) enables interleaving when possible, and `1` forcibly disables interleaving, even if it is possible.  

#### Detailed Explanation
Consider the following pipelined doubly nested loops: 
```cpp
float temp_r[kSize] = ...;
float temp_a[kSize * kSize] = ...;

for (int i = kSize - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
   [[intel::max_interleaving(0 or 1)]] // Controls if interleaving is enabled or disabled on the loop below
   for (int j = kSize - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
      temp_r[i] += SomethingComplicated(temp_a[i * kSize + j], temp_r[i]);
   }
}
```

Notice how `temp_r[i]` is a loop carried dependency in the inner loop. **Crucially, the dependency is with respect to the inner loop and *not* the outer loop.** The same `temp_r[i]` is updated in every inner iteration, but a different element of `temp_r` is updated in different outer iterations. As a result of the loop carried dependency with respect to the inner loop, the II of the inner loop will be very high as a new iteration of the inner loop cannot be invoked until the previous one finishes. 

Without interleaving, this is what the pipelined registers of the inner loop will look like, for II of the inner loop = 5 and II of the outer loop = 1. Each cell shows the (i, j) iteration that is currently in that stage of the inner loop:

| Cycle | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 4 | Stage 5 |
| ---   | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---     |
| 1     | (0, 0)  |
| 2     |         | (0, 0)  |
| 3     |         |         | (0, 0)  |
| 4     |         |         |         | (0, 0)  |
| 5     |         |         |         |         | (0, 0)  |
| 6     | (0, 1)  |

Notice how the majority of the stages are empty, caused by the loop carried dependency.

With interleaving, we get the following: 

| Cycle | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 | Stage 4 | Stage 5 |
| ---   | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---     | ---     |
| 1     | (0, 0)  | 
| 2     | (1, 0)  | (0, 0)  |
| 3     | (2, 0)  | (1, 0)  | (0, 0)  |
| 4     | (3, 0)  | (2, 0)  | (1, 0)  | (0, 0)  |
| 5     | (4, 0)  | (3, 0)  | (2, 0)  | (1, 0)  | (0, 0)  |
| 6     | (0, 1)  | (4, 0)  | (3, 0)  | (2, 0)  | (1, 0)  |

Since the loop carried dependency is not with respect to the outer loop, different *invocations* of the inner loop can be pipelined into the inner loop. Notice how after an initial ramp-up period, the inner loop hardware reaches full occupancy - which will correspond to a higher throughput. 

While interleaving is desired in most situations, there may be some scenarios where you might not want to incur the hardware cost of generating a pipelined datapath that allows interleaving. 

For example, if a loop is non-performance critical and area savings are paramount, interleaving can be disabled. 

Another use case is if loop-carried memory dependencies cannot be determined at compile-time (such as dynamic array index accesses). By default, the compiler will conservatively assume interleaving may happen as to maximize throughput, and supporting hardware will be generated. If the user knows that interleaving cannot or does not frequently happen, they can manually disable interleaving. 

To disable interleaving on a loop, place `[[intel::max_interleaving(1)]]` above that loop, as shown in the example above. 


## Build the `max_interleaving` Tutorial

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulates an FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the HTML optimization reports. (See [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for information on finding and understanding the reports.)

      make report
      ```
   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).

      ```

### On Windows*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for the Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the optimization report. (See [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for information on finding and understanding the reports.)

      ```
> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
### Read the Reports

Locate `report.html` in the `max_interleaving_report.prj/reports/` directory.

#### Verify That Interleaving Is Enabled/Disabled
1. Go to `Throughput Analysis` (dropdown) -> `Loop Analysis`.
2. Under `Loop List`, the 2 loops of interest are:
   1. `KernelCompute_0.inner` - inner loop of interleaving **enabled** kernel
   2. `KernelCompute_1.inner` - inner loop of interleaving **disabled** kernel
3. Find the row in the `Loop Analysis` pane corresponding to `KernelCompute_0.inner`. Notice how the II is high (>> 1) and `Max Interleaving Iterations` is greater than 1, meaning interleaving is enabled.
4. Find the row in the `Loop Analysis` pane corresponding to `KernelCompute_1.inner`. Notice how the II is high (>> 1) but the `Max Interleaving Iterations` is 1, meaning interleaving is disabled due to the attribute.

**IMPORTANT**: As mentioned above, the compiler will do some memory dependency analysis on loops. If it can determine that interleaving cannot happen, interleaving will automatically be disabled (which can be verified in the reports) and the attribute will have no effect. 

#### View the Hardware Area Savings
**NOTE**: For the most accurate numbers, you must compile to hardware so that `Quartus®` can decide where to place each hardware unit on the board.
1. Go to `Summary` (top navigation bar). In the `Summary` pane, go to `Quartus® Fitter Resource Utilization Summary`. For less accurate estimates (but you can obtain these numbers after compiling to report instead of the full hardware flow), go to `Compile Estimated Kernel Resource Utilization Summary`.
2. Verify that `KernelCompute<1>` (interleaving disabled) uses slightly fewer resources (ALMs, ALUTs, REGs, etc.) than `KernelCompute<0>` (interleaving enabled). For example, at the time of writing this tutorial, this is the final resource usage when compiling for the Terasic DE10-Agilex Development Board:

|                 | ALM  | ALUT | REG   | MLAB | RAM | DSP |
| ---             | ---  | ---  | ---   | ---  | --- | --- |
| KernelCompute_0 | 3506 | 3940 | 11393 | 37   | 66  | 6   |
| KernelCompute_1 | 3318 | 3743 | 11028 | 34   | 66  | 6   | 

## Run the `max_interleaving` Sample

### On Linux

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
   ```
   ./max_interleaving.fpga_emu
   ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device.
   ```
   CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./max_interleaving.fpga_sim
   ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`).
   ```
   ./max_interleaving.fpga
   ```

### On Windows

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
   ```
   max_interleaving.fpga_emu.exe
   ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device.
   ```
   set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
   max_interleaving.fpga_sim.exe
   set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
   ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`).
   ```
   max_interleaving.fpga.exe
   ```

## Example Output On FPGA Hardware

```
Running on device: de10_agilex : Agilex Reference Platform (aclde10_agilex0)
Max interleaving 0 kernel time : 0.10368 ms
Throughput for kernel with max_interleaving 0: 0.632 GFlops
Running on device: de10_agilex : Agilex Reference Platform (aclde10_agilex0)
Max interleaving 1 kernel time : 0.922 ms
Throughput for kernel with max_interleaving 1: 0.071 GFlops
PASSED: The results are correct
```

The stdout output shows the giga-floating point operations per second (GFlops) for each kernel.

When run on Terasic's DE10-Agilex Development Board, we see that the throughput is significantly higher for `max_interleaving(0)` (interleaving enabled) than `max_interleaving(1)`, showing the effectiveness of interleaving. However, the kernel using `max_interleaving(1)` uses slightly fewer hardware resources, as shown in the reports. 

While the throughput differences are substantial, if the interleaving loops were a small part of a kernel whose total runtime was an order of magnitude greater than these loops, it may be worth it to disable interleaving for hardware savings.

When run on the FPGA emulator, the `max_interleaving` attribute has no effect on runtime. Additionally, the emulator may sometimes achieve higher throughput than the FPGA. This is especially true if the kernel uses a tiny fraction of the compute resources available on the FPGA.
