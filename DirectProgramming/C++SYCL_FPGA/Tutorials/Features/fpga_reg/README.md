## Purpose

This FPGA tutorial demonstrates an example of using the `ext::intel::fpga_reg` extension to:

* Help reduce the fanout of specific signals in the SYCL-compliant design.
* Improve the overall f<sub>MAX</sub> of the generated hardware.

Note: A f<sub>MAX</sub> improvement is not always possible when using `ext::intel::fpga_reg`.

### Simple Code Example

The signature of `ext::intel::fpga_reg` is as follows:

```cpp
template <typenameT>
T ext::intel::fpga_reg(T input)
```

To use this function in your code, you must include the following header:

```cpp
#include <sycl/ext/intel/fpga_extensions.hpp>
```

When you use this function on any value in your code, the compiler will insert at least one register stage between the input and output of `ext::intel::fpga_reg` function. For example:

```cpp
int func (int input) {
  int output = ext::intel::fpga_reg(input)
  return output;
}
```

This forces the compiler to insert a register between the input and output. You can observe this in the optimization report's System Viewer.

### Understanding the Tutorial Design

The basic function performed by the tutorial kernel is a vector dot product with a pre-adder. The loop is unrolled so that the core part of the algorithm is a feed-forward datapath. The coefficient array is implemented as a circular shift register and rotates by one for each iteration of the outer loop.

The optimization applied in this tutorial impacts the system f<sub>MAX</sub> or the maximum frequency that the design can run at. Since the compiler implements all kernels in a common clock domain, f<sub>MAX</sub> is a global system parameter. To see the impact of the `ext::intel::fpga_reg` optimization in this tutorial, you will need to compile the design twice.

Part 1 compiles the kernel code without setting the `USE_FPGA_REG` macro, whereas Part 2 compiles the kernel while setting this macro. This chooses between two functionally equivalent code segments, but the latter version uses `ext::intel::fpga_reg`. In the `USE_FPGA_REG` version of the code, the compiler is guaranteed to insert at least one register stage between the input and output of each of the calls to `ext::intel::fpga_reg` function.

#### Part 1: Without `USE_FPGA_REG`

The compiler will generate the following hardware for Part 1. The diagram below has been simplified for illustration.

<img src="no_fpga_reg.png" alt="Part 1" title="Part 1" width="400" />

Note the following:

* The compiler automatically infers a tree structure for the series of adders.
* There is a large fanout (of up to 4 in this simplified example) from `val` to each of the adders.

The fanout grows linearly with the unroll factor in this tutorial. In FPGA designs, signals with large fanout can sometimes degrade system f<sub>MAX</sub>. This happens because the FPGA placement algorithm cannot place *all* of the fanout logic elements physically close to the fanout source, leading to longer wires.  In this situation, it can be helpful to add explicit fanout control in your code via `ext::intel::fpga_reg`. This is an advanced optimization for FPGA power-users.

#### Part 2: with `USE_FPGA_REG`

In this part, we added two sets of `ext::intel::fpga_reg` within the unrolled loop. The first is added to pipeline `val` once per iteration. This reduces the fanout of `val` from 4 in the example in Part 1 to just 2. The second `ext::intel::fpga_reg` is inserted between accumulation into the `acc` value. This generates the following structure in hardware.

<img src="fpga_reg.png" alt="Part 2" title="Part 2" width="400" />

In this version, the adder tree has been transformed into a vine-like structure. This increases latency, but it helps us achieve our goal of reducing the fanout and improving f<sub>MAX</sub>.
Since the outer loop is pipelined and has a high trip count, the inner loop's increased latency has a negligible impact on throughput. The tradeoff pays off, as the f<sub>MAX</sub> improvement yields a higher performing design.

## Key Concepts

* How to use the `ext::intel::fpga_reg` extension.
* How `ext::intel::fpga_reg` can be used to re-structure the compiler-generated hardware.
* Situations in which applying  `ext::intel::fpga_reg` might be beneficial.

## Building the `fpga_reg` Design

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux* System

1. Install the design in `build` directory from the design directory by running `cmake`:

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design using the generated `Makefile`. The following four build targets are provided that match the recommended development flow:

   * Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulates an FPGA device) using:

     ```bash
     make fpga_emu
     ```

   * Generate HTML optimization reports using:

     ```bash
     make report
     ```

   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device)

     ```bash
     make fpga_sim
     ```

   * Compile and run on FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets an FPGA device) using:

     ```bash
     make fpga
     ```

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

   ```bat
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

   To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```

   * Generate the optimization report:

     ```
     nmake report
     ```

   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced problem size):

     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```

   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when
compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a
shorter path, for example c:\samples\build. You can then run cmake from that
directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

## Examining the Reports

Locate the pair of `report.html` files in either:

* **Report-only compile**:  `fpga_reg_report.prj` and `fpga_reg_registered_report.prj`
* **FPGA hardware compile**: `fpga_reg.prj` and `fpga_reg_registered.prj`

Open the reports in Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*. Observe the structure of the design in the optimization report's System Viewer and notice the changes within `Cluster 2` of the `SimpleMath.B3` block when compiling with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA. In the report for Part 1, the viewer shows a much more shallow graph compared to the one in Part 2. This is because the operations are performed much closer to one another in Part 1 compared to Part 2. By transforming the code in Part 2, with more register stages, the compiler achieved a higher f<sub>MAX</sub>.

>**NOTE**: Only the report generated after the FPGA hardware compile will reflect the performance benefit of using the `fpga_reg` extension. The difference is *not* apparent in the reports generated by `make report` because a design's f<sub>MAX</sub> cannot be predicted. The final achieved f<sub>MAX</sub> can be found in `fpga_reg.prj/reports/report.html` and `fpga_reg_registered.prj/reports/report.html` (after `make fpga` completes).

## Running the Sample

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):

   ```bash
   ./fpga_reg.fpga_emu    (Linux)
   fpga_reg.fpga_emu.exe  (Windows)
   ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device

  * On Linux
    ```bash
    CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./fpga_reg.fpga_sim
    CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./fpga_reg_registered.fpga_sim
    ```
  * On Windows
    ```bash
    set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
    fpga_reg.fpga_sim.exe
    fpga_reg_registered.fpga_sim.exe
    set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
    ```

3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`):

   ```bash
   ./fpga_reg.fpga                (Linux)
   ./fpga_reg_registered.fpga     (Linux)
   fpga_reg.fpga.exe              (Windows)
   fpga_reg_registered.fpga.exe   (Windows)
   ```

### Example of Output

```txt
Throughput for kernel with input size 1000000 and coefficient array size 64: 2.819272 GFlops
PASSED: Results are correct.
```

### Discussion of Results

You will be able to observe the improvement in the throughput going from Part 1 to Part 2. You will also note that the f<sub>MAX</sub> of Part 2 is significantly larger than of Part 1.
