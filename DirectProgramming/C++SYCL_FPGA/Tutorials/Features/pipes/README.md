## Purpose
This tutorial demonstrates how a kernel in a SYCL*-compliant FPGA program transfers
data to or from another kernel using the pipe abstraction.

### Definition of a Pipe
The primary goal of pipes is to allow concurrent execution of kernels that need
to exchange data.

A pipe is a FIFO data structure connecting two endpoints that communicate
using the pipe's `read` and `write` operations. An endpoint can be either a kernel
or an external I/O on the FPGA. Therefore, there are three types of pipes:
* kernel-kernel
* kernel-I/O
* I/O-kernel

This tutorial focuses on kernel-kernel pipes, but
the concepts discussed here apply to other kinds of pipes as well.

The `read` and `write` operations have two variants:
* Blocking variant: Blocking operations may not return immediately but are always successful.
* Non-blocking variant: Non-blocking operations take an extra boolean parameter
that is set to `true` if the operation happened successfully.

Data flows in a single direction inside pipes. In other words, for a pipe `P`
and two kernels using `P`, one of the kernels is exclusively going to perform
`write` to `P` while the other kernel is exclusively going to perform `read` from
`P`. Bidirectional communication can be achieved using two pipes.

Each pipe has a configurable `capacity` parameter describing the number of `write`
operations that may be performed without any `read` operations being performed. For example,
consider a pipe `P` with capacity 3, and two kernels `K1` and `K2` using
`P`. Assume that `K1` performed the following sequence of operations:

 `write(1)`, `write(2)`, `write(3)`

In this situation, the pipe is full because three (the `capacity` of
`P`) `write` operations were performed without any `read` operation. In this
situation, a `read` must occur before any other `write` is allowed.

If a `write` is attempted to a full pipe, one of two behaviors occurs:

  * If the operation is non-blocking, it returns immediately, and its
  boolean parameter is set to `false`. The `write` does not have any effect.
  * If the operation is blocking, it does not return until a `read` is
  performed by the other endpoint. Once the `read` is performed, the `write`
  takes place.

The blocking and non-blocking `read` operations have analogous behaviors when
the pipe is empty.

### Defining a Pipe

SYCL*-compliant pipes are defined as a class with static members. To declare a pipe that
transfers integer data and has  `capacity=4`, use a type alias:

```c++
using ProducerToConsumerPipe = pipe<  // Defined in the SYCL headers.
  class ProducerConsumerPipe,         // An identifier for the pipe.
  int,                                // The type of data in the pipe.
  4>;                                 // The capacity of the pipe.
```

The `class ProducerToConsumerPipe` template parameter is important to the
uniqueness of the pipe. This class need not be defined but must be distinct
for each pipe. Consider another type alias with the exact same parameters:

```c++
using ProducerToConsumerPipe2 = pipe<  // Defined in the SYCL headers.
  class ProducerConsumerPipe,          // An identifier for the pipe.
  int,                                 // The type of data in the pipe.
  4>;                                  // The capacity of the pipe.
```

The uniqueness of a pipe is derived from a combination of all three template
parameters. Since `ProducerToConsumerPipe` and `ProducerToConsumerPipe2` have
the same template parameters, they define the same pipe.

### Using a Pipe

This code sample defines a `Consumer` and a `Producer` kernel connected
by the pipe `ProducerToConsumerPipe`. Kernels use the
`ProducerToConsumerPipe::write` and `ProducerToConsumerPipe::read` methods for
communication.

The `Producer` kernel reads integers from the global memory and writes those integers
into `ProducerToConsumerPipe`, as shown in the following code snippet:

```c++
void Producer(queue &q, buffer<int, 1> &input_buffer) {
  std::cout << "Enqueuing producer...\n";

  auto e = q.submit([&](handler &h) {
    accessor input_accessor(input_buffer, h, read_only);
    auto num_elements = input_buffer.get_count();

    h.single_task<ProducerTutorial>([=]() {
      for (size_t i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i) {
        ProducerToConsumerPipe::write(input_accessor[i]);
      }
    });
  });
}
```

The `Consumer` kernel reads integers from `ProducerToConsumerPipe`, processes
the integers (`ConsumerWork(i)`), and writes the result into the global memory.

```c++
void Consumer(queue &q, buffer<int, 1> &output_buffer) {
  std::cout << "Enqueuing consumer...\n";

  auto e = q.submit([&](handler &h) {
    accessor out_accessor(out_buf, h, write_only, no_init);
    size_t num_elements = output_buffer.get_count();

    h.single_task<ConsumerTutorial>([=]() {
      for (size_t i = 0; i < num_elements; ++i) {
        int input = ProducerToConsumerPipe::read();
        int answer = ConsumerWork(input);
        output_accessor[i] = answer;
      }
    });
  });
}
```

> **Note**: The `read` and `write` operations used are blocking. If
`ConsumerWork` is an expensive operation, then `Producer` might fill
`ProducerToConsumerPipe` faster than `Consumer` can read from it, causing
`Producer` to block occasionally.

* How to declare and use pipes in a program.

## Building the `pipes` Tutorial

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake ..
  ```

  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.
2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced data size):
     ```
     make fpga_sim
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
  ```
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ```
  To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
  ```
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
  ```
  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced data size):
     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `pipes_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

Navigate to the "System Viewer" to visualize the structure of the kernel system. Identify the pipe connecting the two kernels.

## Running the Sample

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./pipes.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     pipes.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device:
  * On Linux
    ```bash
    CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./pipes.fpga_sim
    ```
  * On Windows
    ```bash
    set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
    pipes.fpga_sim.exe
    set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
    ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`):
     ```
     ./pipes.fpga         (Linux)
     pipes.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```
