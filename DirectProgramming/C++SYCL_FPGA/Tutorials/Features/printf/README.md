## Purpose
This tutorial shows how to use some simple macros to enable easy use of the SYCL `printf()` function. This function allows printing from within code running on the FPGA.

### Motivation
Previously, we've provided examples for how to print data using the Stream class in the [FPGA Optimization Guide for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide/top/flags-attr-prag-ext/kernel-controls/pipes-extension/i-o-pipes.html).

Compare to the Stream class, `printf()` has the following advantages:

* `printf()` is a function that is globally available; Stream is an object which can only be obtained by passing it as a kernel argument from the host. In order to use Stream somewhere within your application, you have to pass the Stream object through the whole call stack. For debugging in large applications, using `printf()` has a great advantage allowing you to quickly add some print statements and easy to remove later without changing your main code.

* On the FPGA device, `printf()` has smaller area usage (less LSUs) and better performance (Stream could introduce massive II inner loops).

### Simple Code Example

Using `printf()` can be verbose in SYCL kernels. To simplify, add the following macro to your code.

```cpp
#ifdef __SYCL_DEVICE_ONLY__
  #define CL_CONSTANT __attribute__((opencl_constant))
#else
  #define CL_CONSTANT
#endif

#define PRINTF(format, ...) { \
            static const CL_CONSTANT char _format[] = format; \
            sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::printf(_format, ## __VA_ARGS__); }

PRINTF("Hello, World!\n");
PRINTF("Hello: %d\n", 123);
```

## Building the `printf` Tutorial

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. 
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. 
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
    To compile for the default target (the Agilex® device family), run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```

    > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
    >  ```
    >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
    >  ``` 
    >
    > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command: 
    >  ```
    >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1
    >  ``` 
    >
    > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   * Compile for simulation (medium compile time, targets simulated FPGA device):
      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     make report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     make fpga
     ```

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```
    To compile for the default target (the Agilex® device family), run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
    ```
    > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
    >  ```
    >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
    >  ``` 
    >
    > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command: 
    >  ```
    >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DIS_BSP=1
    >  ``` 
    >
    > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```
   * Compile for simulation (medium compile time, targets simulated FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```
   * Generate the optimization report:
     ```
     nmake report
     ```
   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

## Examining the Reports
Locate `report.html` in the `printf_report.prj/reports/` directory. Open the report in Chrome*, Firefox*, Edge*, or Internet Explorer*.

From the report, you can find the compilation information of the design and the estimated FPGA resource usage. For example, navigate to the Area Analysis section of the report (**Kernel System > BasicKernel > Computation**), and you can see the estimated resource usage (ALUTs, FFs, RAMs, etc.) for each `printf()` call.

## Running the Sample

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):
     ```
     ./printf.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     printf.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator:
    * On Linux
        ```
        CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./printf.fpga_sim
        ```
    * On Windows
        ```
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
        printf.fpga_sim.exe
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
        ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`):
     ```
     ./printf.fpga         (Linux)
     printf.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```

### Example of Output

Result8: Preceding with blanks:       1977
Result9: Preceding with zeros: 0000001977
Result10: Some different radices: 100 64 144 0x64 0144
Result11: ABCD
```

## Known issues and limitations

There are some known issues with the `experimental::printf()` and that's why the function is in the experimental namespace. The following limitations exist when using `experimental::printf()` on FPGA simulation and hardware:

* If you have multiple PRINTF statements in the kernel, the order of printed data in the stdout might not obey the sequential order of those statements in the code.
* Buffer is only flushed to stdout after the kernel finishes in hardware.
* Printing `long` integers in Windows results is not supported yet. Printing `long` integers in Linux works as intended.
