## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates how and when to apply the `max_reinvocation_delay` attribute to a loop in your program to direct the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler to implement that loop with a specified maximum loop reinvocation delay. The loop reinvocation delay is the delay between launching the last iteration of a loop invocation and launching the first iteration of the next loop invocation.

## Key Implementation Details

Apply the `[[intel::max_reinvocation_delay(N)]]` attribute to loops in your program on which you want to specify a maximum loop reinvocation delay. The *loop reinvocation delay* is defined as the latency between the last iteration of a loop invocation and the first iteration of the next invocation of that loop. 

> **Note**:  A loop **invocation** begins when the program flow enters a loop for the first time, while an **iteration** begins each time the program flow enters the loop body. In the example below, the `i` loop will have `sequence_length` iterations for each invocation. It will be invoked once for each **iteration** of the outer `factor` loop.

The attribute parameter `N` is required and must be a positive constant expression of integer type. This parameter controls the maximum loop reinvocation delay allowed, measured in clock cycles. Currently, only `N=1` is supported, i.e., that there should be no delay between invocations. If you do not specify this attribute, the compiler may insert some delay to improve fMAX as shown in the following example.

### Example

Consider the following loop nest:

```c++
for (int factor = 0; factor < kFactors; factor++) {
  for (int i = 0; i < sequence_length; i++) {
    PipeOut::write(first_term + i * factor);
  }
}
```

By default, the compiler inserts a loop reinvocation delay of a few cycles on the inner loop. In general, the compiler may insert a higher loop reinvocation delay to better optimize a loop by enabling loop speculation or by pipelining the loop orchestration hardware, which can increase fMAX. This delay can be seen by observing the transactions coming out of the streaming interface associated with `PipeOut`.

![default behavior with delay between invocations](assets/default.png)

However, the extra latency between invocations of a loop can have a significant impact in performance if the loop has a very small trip count. Applying `[[intel::max_reinvocation_delay(1)]]` to the inner loop allows us to remove this delay between invocations. 

```c++
for (int factor = 0; factor < kFactors; factor++) {
  [[intel::max_reinvocation_delay(1)]]
  for (int i = 0; i < sequence_length; i++) {
    PipeOut::write(first_term + i * factor);
  }
}
```

Now, the first iteration of the `i+1`th  invocation of the inner loop will launch immediately following the final iteration of the `i`th invocation of the inner loop.

## Build the `max_reinvocation_delay` Tutorial

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   > For simplicity, this tutorial only uses the SYCL HLS flow and does not support targeting an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the optimization reports.
      ```
      make report
      ```
   3. Compile and run for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets an FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga
      ```

### On Windows*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for the Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   > For simplicity, this tutorial only uses the SYCL HLS flow and does not support targeting an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the optimization reports.
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
   3. Compile and run for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets an FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```

> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
## Run the `max_reinvocation_delay` Sample

### On Linux

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
   ```
   ./max_reinvocation_delay.fpga_emu
   ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device.
   ```
   CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./max_reinvocation_delay.fpga_sim

   ```
2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device.
   ```
   set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
