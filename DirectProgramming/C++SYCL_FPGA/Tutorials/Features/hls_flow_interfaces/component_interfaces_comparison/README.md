## IP Component Interfaces
When you create an FPGA multi-architecture binary for an accelerator card equipped with a board support package (BSP), the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler will infer a set of interfaces for you that fits your selected BSP. When you create FPGA IP with the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler, you can customize the interfaces for your IP component, since IP components are not constrained by specific attach points in a specific BSP.

## Invocation Interface
The invocation interface is generated by the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler and controls how your FPGA IP communicates with the rest of your system. This interface lets your system start the component and (optionally) pass input arguments, and lets the component inform the system when it is finished. There are two ways that the invocation interface can be implemented:

1. As signals mapped to the IP's control/status register (CSR)
2. As a handshake similar to the ready/valid handshake used by streaming interfaces.

### Register-mapped
The signals for starting your component, and the signals used by the component to signal its status are mapped to registers accessible through an Avalon memory-mapped agent interface. You should use a register-mapped invocation interface if your component will operate in a system like this:

![](assets/invocation_mm_agent.svg)

By default, the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler generates a register-mapped invocation interface for kernels, as you may observe in the [Naive Design](naive).

### Streaming
The signals for starting your component and the signals used by the component to signal its status appear as dedicated conduits on your IP component. These signals mimic the ready-valid handshake commonly used by streaming interfaces. You should use a streaming invocation interface if your component will operate in a system like this:

![](assets/invocation_streaming.svg)

The streaming invocation handshake resembles an Avalon streaming transaction. The IP kernel begins operating on the clock cycle that the `start` and `ready_out` signals are asserted. The IP component kernel invocation is finished on the clock cycle that the `done` and `ready_in` signals are asserted.

For details on how to configure a streaming invocation interface, go to [streaming-invocation](streaming-invocation)

## Data Interface
The data interfaces allow data to enter and leave your component's data path. SYCL kernels do not have return types, so you must use one of the following three data interfaces to pass output data:

1. Memory-mapped host interface
2. Streaming interface
3. Memory-mapped agent (CSR)

### Memory-Mapped Host
When your data resides in an off-kernel memory (for example: global memory or off-chip DRAM, or an on-chip block RAM) you can use a memory-mapped host data interface to communicate with it. Memory-mapped host  interfaces are inferred by default for all pointer members in oneAPI kernels, as you may observe in the [Naive Design](naive).

![](assets/data_mm_host.svg)

You can customize this interface by explicitly declaring interfaces with the `annotated_arg` type. See [mm-host](mm-host/) part of this tutorial for an example of how to do this. For more information on the customization of Memory-mapped host interfaces, see this dedicated [mmhost](/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/Tutorials/Features/hls_flow_interfaces/mmhost) code sample.

### Stream (Pipe)
You may also choose to stream data into/out of your kernel using pipes. Pipes are a first-in first-out (FIFO) buffer construct that provide links between elements of a design. The Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler provides host pipes for host-kernel streaming and inter-kernel pipes for kernel-kernel streaming. The [pipes](pipes/) example demonstrates how to use host pipes to read and write data through an Avalon streaming interface that can be connected to other IP components in an FPGA design. 

![](assets/data_streaming.svg)

### Memory-Mapped Agent (Control/Status Register)
You may wish to register your data in a memory-mapped register space.

![](assets/data_mm_agent.svg)

There are two ways you can do this:
- Use (non-pointer) members of your functor. This is the default way to get data into your kernel as demonstrated in the [Naive Design](naive).
- Use host pipes configured to use the `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::protocol_avalon_mm` protocol. Please review the [csr-pipes](csr-pipes/) example design.

## Sample Structure
There are 5 different example designs in this sample, all of which implement a simple vector addition. You can compare the C++ source code for each of these designs.
1. [Naive](naive/) This simple vector add implementation is similar to the one presented in the [fpga_compile](/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/Tutorials/GettingStarted/fpga_compile) code sample. It demonstrates a kernel that uses a register-mapped invocation interface, and a single shared memory-mapped host data interface. This is the only design that can support the full-system compilation flow, since the other designs implement interface customizations that are not supported by any BSP.
2. [Streaming invocation](streaming-invocation/) This implementation uses a streaming invocation interface and conduits to pass the input pointer arguments instead of the CSR. It uses a single, shared memory-mapped host data interface.
3. [Customized memory-mapped host data interface](mm-host/) This implementation uses a register-mapped invocation interface, and demonstrates how to use `annotated_arg` to customize the memory-mapped host data interface.
4. [Streaming Data (pipes)](pipes/) This implementation uses a register-mapped invocation interface, and demonstrates how to use pipes to configure a streaming data interface.
5. [CSR Data](csr-pipes/) This implementation uses a register-mapped invocation interface, and demonstrates how to use host pipes to configure a streaming data interface, and how to return output into the CSR using the `protocol_avalon_mm` pipe protocol.

## Build a Design

All designs in this sample supports four compilation options: Emulator, Simulator, Optimization Report, FPGA Hardware. For details on the different compilation options, see the [fpga_compile](/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/Tutorials/GettingStarted/fpga_compile) tutorial.

Use the appropriate TYPE parameter when running CMake to config which design to compile:
| Example                                      | Directory             | Type (-DTYPE=) |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------|

| Customized memory-mapped host data interface | mm-host/              | MMHOST         |
| Streaming Data (pipes)                       | pipes/                | PIPES          |
| CSR Data                                     | csr-pipes/            | CSR            |


> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. 
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. 
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

>**Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example `C:\samples\build`. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
