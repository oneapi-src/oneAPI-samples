## Purpose

The sample demonstrates the differences between streaming invocation interfaces that use a ready/valid handshake and register-mapped invocation interfaces that exist in the control/status register (CSR) of FPGA IP produced with the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.

Use the `get` kernel properties method to specify how the IP is started, and `annotated_arg` wrapper to specify how arguments are passed to the IP.

## Key Implementation Details

The sample demonstrates in detail how to declare kernel invocation interfaces and kernel argument interfaces.

### Understanding Register-Mapped and Streaming Interfaces

The kernel invocation interface (namely, the `start` and `done` signals) can be implemented in the kernel's CSR, or using a ready/valid handshake. Similarly, the kernel arguments can be passed through the CSR, or through dedicated conduits. 

| Register-mapped Invocation with Register-mapped Arguments | Streaming Invocation with Conduit Arguments
|:--:                                                       |:--:
| ![](assets/invocation_mm_agent_args.svg)                  | ![](assets/invocation_streaming_args.svg)

The invocation interface and any argument interfaces are specified independently, so you may choose to implement the invocation interface with a ready/valid handshake, and implement the kernel arguments in the CSR. The following table lists valid kernel argument interface synchronizations.

| Invocation Interface    | Argument Interface    | Argument Interface Synchronization
|:---                     |:---                   |:---
| Streaming               | Conduit               | Consumed when `<kernel_name>_streaming_start`=1 and `<kernel_name>_streaming_ready_out`=0 
| Streaming               | Register-mapped       | Consumed if written one clock cycle before `<kernel_name>_streaming_start`=1 and `<kernel_name>_streaming_ready_out`=0 
| Register-mapped         | Conduit               | Consumed one clock cycle after writing to the `start` register 
| Register-mapped         | Register-mapped       | Consumed if written any time before writing to the `start` register 

If you would like an argument to have its own **dedicated** ready/valid handshake, implement that argument using a [streaming interface](../streaming_data_interfaces/).

> **Note**: The register-mapped and streaming interface features are **only** supported in the SYCL HLS flow. The SYCL HLS flow compiles SYCL* source code to IPs that can be deployed into your Intel® Quartus® Prime projects. Emulator and simulator executables are still generated to allow you to validate your IP. You can compile the generated RTL with Intel® Quartus® Prime to generate accurate f<sub>MAX</sub> and area estimates. However, the six `.fpga` executables generated in this tutorial are **not** designed to run on FPGA devices directly.

### Declaring a Register-Mapped Invocation Interface

By default, your IP's `start` and `done` signals will appear in the IP's CSR. This is true whether you declare your kernel using the 'functor' or 'lambda' syntax.

#### Functor Syntax

```c++
struct MyIP {
  ...
  void operator()() const {
    ...
  }
};

...

q.single_task(MyIP{});
```

#### Lambda Syntax

```c++
void myIPFunction() {
  ...
}

...

q.single_task([=] {
  myIPFunction();
  ...
});
```

You can see concrete examples of kernels that use register-mapped invocation interfaces in `src/reg_map_functor.cpp` and `src/reg_map_lambda.cpp` 


### Declaring a Streaming Invocation Interface

You can force your IP's `start` and `done` signals to appear as signals on your IP boundary by adding the `streaming_interface` kernel property.

Using the property `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::streaming_interface<>` or `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::streaming_interface_accept_downstream_stall` configures a streaming invocation interface with a `ready_in` interface to allow down-stream components to backpressure. You can choose to remove the `ready_in` interface by using `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::streaming_interface<remove_downstream_stall>` or `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::streaming_interface_remove_downstream_stall` instead. If you omit the `streaming_interface` property, the compiler will configure your kernel with a register-mapped invocation interface. The syntax for declaring a kernel property is different depending on if you use the functor syntax or the lambda syntax, but the `streaming_interface` property is the same. 


#### Functor Syntax

If you declare your kernel using the functor syntax, you must declare your kernel properties in the `get()` function, as shown here:

```c++
struct MyIP {
  ...
  auto get(sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties_tag) {
      return sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties {
          sycl::ext::intel::experimental::streaming_interface<>
      };
  }
  void operator()() const {
    ...
  }
};

...

q.single_task(MyIP{});
```

`src/stream_functor.cpp` and `src/stream_lambda.cpp`
demonstrate two different kernels that use a streaming invocation interface.
`src/stream_rm_stall.cpp` demonstrates a kernel
that has a streaming invocation interface with the `ready_in` signal disabled.

#### Lambda Syntax

If you declare your kernel using the lambda syntax, you must declare your kernel properties in an object that you pass to the `single_task()` function.

```c++
sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties kernel_properties {
  sycl::ext::intel::experimental::streaming_interface<>,
};

q.single_task(kernel_properties, [=] {
  ...
})
```

#### Pipelined Streaming Invocation Interface

SYCL* task kernels are non-pipelined by default, meaning the next kernel invocation can only be started after the previous one has completed its execution. Kernels with a streaming kernel invocation interface can optionally be pipelined to increase the throughput of the kernel. A pipelined kernel is one that can be invoked while the previous kernel invocation is still executing, making full use of the entire hardware pipeline. The delay between successive invocations is called the initiation interval (II).

| Non-pipelined Invocation | Pipelined Invocation with II=1
|:--:                      |:--:
| ![](assets/non-pipelined.png) | ![](assets/pipelined.png)

The kernel property `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::pipelined` takes an optional template parameter that controls whether to pipeline the kernel. Valid parameters are:
- **-1**: Pipeline the kernel, and automatically infer lowest possible II at target fMAX.
- **0**: Do not pipeline the kernel.
- **N (N> 0)**: Pipeline the kernel, and force the II of the kernel to be N.

If a parameter is not specified, the default parameter of `-1` will be inferred, so the compiler will make its best effort to achieve the lowest kernel II. 

> **Note**: The `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::pipelined<>` property only supports kernels with a streaming invocation interface.

When you invoke a kernel with a pipelined streaming interface, you should only call the `wait()` blocking function after all kernel invocations have launched.

```c++
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
	q.single_task<StreamPipelined>(StreamPipelinedIP{&input[i], &functor_streaming_pipelined_out[i]});
}
q.wait();
```

For an example of a pipelined streaming kernel, see `src/stream_pipelined.cpp`.

### Customizing the Kernel Argument Interface

You can use the `sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::annotated_arg` wrapper type to customize whether a kernel argument should be passed to the IP component as a conduit, or through the CSR. If you do not specify an `annotated_arg` wrapper, the compiler will infer an argument interface based on your invocation interface.

| Invocation Interface | Automatically Inferred Argument Interface | SYCL* Property
|:--                   |:--                                        |:--
| Register-mapped      | Register-mapped                           | `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::register_map`
| Streaming            | Conduit                                   | `sycl::ext::intel::experimental::conduit`


You can add a `conduit` property to an `annotated_arg` like this:

```c++
struct MyIP {
  sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::annotated_arg<
    int, decltype(sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties {
                  sycl::ext::intel::experimental::conduit})>
  arg1;
  void operator()() const {
    ...
    // access arg1 here
  }
};
```

> **Note**: If you use a `struct` or `class` type as the payload of an `annotated_arg`, you must cast away the `annotated_arg` wrapper to access the members and methods of your `struct` or `class`. In particular, this applies to `ac_int` types. If you forget to cast away the `annotated_arg` wrapper and try to access members or methods anyway, you will see a compiler error.
> 
> ```c++
> using MyUInt5 = ac_int<5, false>;
> 
> struct FunctorRegMapIP {
> 
>   int *input;
>   int *output;
> 
>   // A kernel with a register map invocation interface can also independently
>   // have streaming kernel arguments, when annotated by 'conduit' property.
>   sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::annotated_arg<
>     MyUInt5, decltype(sycl::ext::oneapi::experimental::properties{
>                   sycl::ext::intel::experimental::conduit})>
>     n;
> 
>   // Without kernel invocation interface annotation, a register-mapped invocation
>   // interface will be inferred by the compiler.
>   void operator()() const {
>     // For annotated_arg of ac_int type, explicitly cast away the annotated_arg
>     // to prevent compiler error when using methods or accessing members.
>     for (MyUInt5 i = 0; i < ((MyUInt5)n).slc<5>(0); i++) { 
>       output[i] = input[i] * (input[i] + 1);
>     }
>   }
> };
> ```
> This is demonstrated in `src/reg_map_functor.cpp`, `src/reg_map_lambda.cpp` and `src/stream_functor.cpp`.

## Build the `Invocation Interfaces` Tutorial

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Read the Reports

1. Locate `report.html` in the corresponding `<source_file>_report.prj/reports/` directory.

2. Open the **Views** menu and select **System Viewer**.

In the left-hand pane, select **FunctorRegMap** or **LambdaRegMap** under the System hierarchy for the kernels with a register-mapped invocation interface.

In the main **System Viewer** pane, the kernel invocation interfaces and kernel arguments interfaces are shown. They show that the `start`, `busy`, and `done` kernel invocation interfaces are implemented in register map interfaces, and the `arg_input` and `arg_output` kernel arguments are implemented in register map interfaces. The `arg_n` kernel argument is implemented in a streaming interface in both the **FunctorRegMap**, and **LambdaRegMap**.

Similarly, in the left-hand pane, select **FunctorStream**, **StreamRmStall**, **StreamPipelined** or **LambdaStream** under the System hierarchy for the kernels with a streaming invocation interface.

In the main **System Viewer** pane, the kernel invocation interfaces and kernel arguments interfaces are shown. They show that the `start`, `done`, `ready_in`, and `ready_out` kernel invocation interfaces are implemented in streaming interfaces. The `arg_input` kernel argument are implemented in streaming interfaces, `arg_n` kernel argument are implemented in streaming interfaces except for **StreamPipelined** which does not have this argument input and `arg_output` kernel argument are implemented in a register map interface in the **FunctorStream** and **StreamRmStall**, and in a streaming interface in the **StreamPipelined** and **LambdaStream**.

> **Note**: Kernel invocation interfaces `ready_in` and `ready_out` are shown as `stall_in` and `stall_out` respectively.

> **Note**: The report of **StreamRmStall** shows the internals of the kernel. Thus, there is a `stall_in`, but tied to ground and not seen at the device image boundary.

### Example Simulation Waveform

The diagram below shows the example waveform generated by the simulator that you will see for the kernels with a register-mapped invocation interface. The waveform shows the register-mapped kernel arguments and kernel invocation handshaking signals are passed in through an Avalon agent interface, whose addresses are as specified in the agent memory map header files in the project directory.

![register_map_invocation_interface](assets/register_map_invocation_interface.png)

The diagram below shows the example waveform generated by the simulator that you will see for the kernels with a streaming invocation interface. The waveform shows the streaming kernel arguments and kernel invocation handshaking signals follow the Avalon-ST protocol. The register map arguments need to be written before the `start` signal is asserted. The streaming invocation interface consumes the streaming kernel arguments on the clock cycle that the `start` and `ready_out` signals are asserted, and the kernel invocation is finished on the clock cycle that the `done` and `ready_in` signals are asserted.

![streaming_invocation_interface](assets/streaming_invocation_interface.png)

The diagram below shows the example waveform generated by the simulator that you will see for the pipelined kernel design. The waveform shows that the kernel is always ready, and 4 consecutive kernel invocations are launched with the `start` signal being asserted for 4 consecutive clock cycles. When the 4 kernel execution finishes, the `done` signal is asserted for 4 consecutive clock cycles.
