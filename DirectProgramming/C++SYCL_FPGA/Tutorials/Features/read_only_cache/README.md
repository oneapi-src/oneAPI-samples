# `Read-Only Cache` Sample

This sample is an FPGA tutorial that demonstrates how to use the read-only cache feature to boost
the throughput of a SYCL*-compliant FPGA design that requires reading from off-chip
memory in a non-contiguous manner.

## Purpose

This FPGA tutorial is an example of how to use read-only cache to
boost the throughput of an FPGA design. Specifically, the read-only cache
is most appropriate for non-contiguous read accesses from off-chip memory
buffers that are guaranteed to be constant throughout the execution of a
kernel. The read-only cache is optimized for high cache hit performance.

To enable the read-only cache, the `-Xsread-only-cache-size<N>` flag should be
passed to the `icpx` command. Each kernel will get its own *private* version
of the cache that serves all reads in the kernel from read-only no-alias
accessors. Read-only no-alias accessors are accessors that have both the
`read_only` and the `no_alias` properties:

```c++
accessor sqrt_lut(sqrt_lut_buf, h, read_only, accessor_property_list{no_alias});
```

The `read_only` property is required because the cache is **read-only**. The
`no_alias` property is required to guarantee that the buffer will not be
written to from the kernel through another accessor or through a USM pointer.
You do not need to apply the `no_alias` property if the kernel already has the
`[[intel::kernel_args_restrict]]` attribute.

Each private cache is also replicated as many times as needed so that it can
expose extra read ports. The size of each replicate is `N` bytes as specified
by the `-Xsread-only-cache-size=<N>` flag.

## Key Implementation Details

The sample illustrates the following important concepts.

- How to use the read-only cache feature.
- Understanding scenarios in which this feature can help improve the throughput of a
  design.

### Tutorial Design

The basic function performed by the tutorial kernel is a series of table
lookups from a buffer (`sqrt_lut_buf`) that contains the square root values of
the first 512 integers. By default, the compiler will generate load-store units
(LSUs) optimized for the case where global memory accesses are
contiguous. When the memory accesses are non-contiguous, as is the case in this
tutorial design, these LSUs tend to suffer major throughput loss. The read-only
cache can sometimes help in such situations, especially when sized correctly.

This tutorial requires compiling the source code twice: once with the
`-Xsread-only-cache-size=<N>` flag and once without it. Because the look-up
table contains 512 integers as indicated by the `kLUTSize` constant, the chosen
size of the cache is `512*4 bytes = 2048 bytes`, and so, the flag
`-Xsread-only-cache-size=2048` is passed to `icpx`.

## Build the `Read-Only Cache` Tutorial

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see *[Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html)* or *[Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html)*.

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulates an FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the HTML optimization reports. (See [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for information on finding and understanding the reports.)
      ```
      make report
      ```
   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile and run on FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets an FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga
      ```

### On Windows*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for the Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the optimization report. (See [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for information on finding and understanding the reports.)
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced problem size).
      ```
      nmake fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```
> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
## Read the Reports

Locate the pair of `report.html` files in the
`read_only_cache_disabled_report.prj` and `read_only_cache_enabled_report.prj`
directories.

Navigate to the "Area Analysis of System" section of each report
(Area Analysis > Area Analysis of System) and expand the "Kernel System" entry
in the table. Notice that when the read-only cache is enabled, a new entry
shows up in the table called "Constant cache interconnect" indicating that the
cache has been created.

## Run the `Read-Only Cache` Sample

### On Linux

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
    ```
    ./read_only_cache.fpga_emu
    ```
    > **Note**: The read-only cache is not implemented in emulation. The `-Xsread-only-cache-size<N>` flag does not impact the emulator in any way, which is why we only have a single executable for this flow.

2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulation device (two executables should be generated).
   ```
   CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./read_only_cache.fpga_sim
   ```
   > **Note**: Although the circuit for the read-only cache is implemented in simulation, one cannot see consistent performance increases with the cache enabled, as each clock cycle in the simulator does not have a consistent latency as it does in the hardware. For this reason here is just a single executable for this flow.

3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`).
   ```
   ./read_only_cache_disabled.fpga
   ./read_only_cache_enabled.fpga
   ```

### On Windows

 1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
    ```
    read_only_cache.fpga_emu.exe
    ```
    > **Note**: The read-only cache is not implemented in emulation. The `-Xsread-only-cache-size<N>` flag does not impact the emulator in any way, which is why we only have a single executable for this flow.

2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulation device (two executables should be generated).
   ```
   set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
   read_only_cache.fpga_sim.exe
   set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
   ```
   > **Note**: Although the circuit for the read-only cache is implemented in simulation, one cannot see consistent performance increases with the cache enabled, as each clock cycle in the simulator does not have a consistent latency as it does in the hardware. For this reason here is just a single executable for this flow.

3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`).
   ```
   read_only_cache_disabled.fpga.exe
   read_only_cache_enabled.fpga.exe
   ```

### Example Output for `./read_only_cache_disabled.fpga`

```
Running on device: de10_agilex : Agilex Reference Platform (aclde10_agilex0)

SQRT LUT size: 512
Number of outputs: 131072
Verification PASSED

Kernel execution time: 0.000849 seconds

```

A test compile of this tutorial design achieved the following results on Terasic's DE10-Agilex Development Board:

|Configuration    | Execution Time (ms) | Throughput (MB/s)
|:---             |:---                 |:---
|Without caching  | 1.677               | 298.18
|With caching     | 0.849               | 589.15

When the read-only cache is enabled, performance notably increases. As
previously mentioned, when the global memory accesses are random (for example, non-contiguous), enabling the read-only cache and sizing it correctly may allow
the design to achieve a higher throughput.
