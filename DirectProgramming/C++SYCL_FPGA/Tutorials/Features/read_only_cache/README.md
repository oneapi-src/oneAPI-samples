# FPGA support was removed from the Intel® oneAPI Toolkits starting 2025.1

Deprecation Notice: The Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler integrated support for Altera FPGA is now deprecated and will be removed with the compiler's release in the first quarter of 2025. Altera* will continue to provide FPGA support through their dedicated FPGA software development tools. Existing customers can continue to use the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2025.0 release which supports FPGA development and is available through Linux* package managers such as APT, YUM/DNF, or Zypper. Additionally, customers with an active support license can access the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2025.0 via their customer support account. 

Find FPGA samples for earlier versions of the compiler than 2025.0 by selecting the appropriate [tag](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tags) in this repository.
Find FPGA samples for 2025.0 and subsequent patches in the new Altera [hls-samples](https://github.com/altera-fpga/hls-samples) git repository.
