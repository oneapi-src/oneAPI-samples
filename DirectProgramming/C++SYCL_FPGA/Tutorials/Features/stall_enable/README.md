# `Stall Enable` Sample

This sample is an FPGA tutorial that demonstrates how to use the `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute to reduce the area and computation latency of your FPGA kernels. This attribute may reduce the FPGA FMax for your kernels.

## Purpose

The `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute enables you to direct the compiler to reduce the area and latency of your kernel.  Reducing the latency will not have a large effect on loops that are pipelined, unless the number of iterations of the loop is very small.
Computations in an FPGA kernel are normally grouped into *Stall Free Clusters*. This allows simplification of the signals within the cluster, but there is a FIFO queue at the end of the cluster that is used to save intermediate results if the computation needs to stall. *Stall Enable Clusters* save area and cycles by removing the FIFO queue and passing the stall signals to each part of the computation.  These extra signals may cause the FMax to be reduced.

> **Note**: If you specify `[[intel::use_stall_enable_clusters]]` on one or more kernels, this may reduce the FMax of the generated FPGA bitstream, which may reduce performance on all kernels.

> **Note**: The `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute is not applicable for designs that target FPGA architectures that support hyper optimized handshaking, unless the `-Xshyper-optimized-handshaking=off` argument is passed to `icpx`.

## Key Implementation Details

The sample illustrates the following important concepts.

- Description of the `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute
- How `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute affects resource usage and loop throughput
- How to apply the `use_stall_enable_clusters` attribute to kernels in your program

### Example of Using the `use_stall_enable_clusters` Attribute

```c++
h.single_task<class KernelComputeStallFree>( [=]() [[intel::use_stall_enable_clusters]] {
  // The computations in this device kernel will use Stall Enable clusters
  Work(accessor_vec_a, accessor_vec_b, accessor_res);
});
```

The FPGA compiler will use *Stall Enable Clusters* for the kernel when possible.  Some computations may not be able to stall and need to be placed in a *Stall Free Cluster*.

## Build the `Stall Enable` Tutorial

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see *[Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html)* or *[Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html)*.

### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

   > **Note**: For targets that support hyper-optimized handshaking, you must disable the handshaking with `-DNO_HYPER_OPTIMIZATION=true`.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile and run for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulates an FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the HTML optimization reports. (See [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for information on finding and understanding the reports.)
      ```
      make report
      ```
   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile and run on FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets an FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga
      ```

### On Windows*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for the Intel® Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

   > **Note**: For targets that support hyper-optimized handshaking, you must disable the handshaking with `-DNO_HYPER_OPTIMIZATION=true`.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate the optimization report. (See [Read the Reports](#read-the-reports) below for information on finding and understanding the reports.)
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced problem size).
      ```
      nmake fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```
> **Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your 'build' directory in a shorter path, for example c:\samples\build.  You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory, for example:
>
>  ```
  > C:\samples\build> cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" C:\long\path\to\code\sample\CMakeLists.txt
>  ```
## Read the Reports

Locate `report.html` in the `stall_enable_report.prj/reports/` and `stall_free_report.prj/reports/` directories.

On the main report page, scroll down to the section titled `Compile Estimated Kernel Resource Utilization Summary`. Note that the estimated number of **MLAB**s for KernelComputeStallEnable is smaller than that of KernelComputeStallFree. The reduction in MLABs is due to the elimination of the FIFO queue at the end of the cluster.

## Run the `Stall Enable` Sample

### On Linux

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
   ```
   ./stall_enable.fpga_emu

   CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./stall_free.fpga_sim
   ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`).
   ```
   ./stall_enable.fpga
   ./stall_free.fpga
   ```

   stall_free.fpga_sim.exe
   set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
   ```
3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`).
