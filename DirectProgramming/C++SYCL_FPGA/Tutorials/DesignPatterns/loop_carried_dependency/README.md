## Key Implementation Details

This tutorial demonstrates how to remove a loop-carried dependency in FPGA device code.

A snippet of the baseline unoptimized code (the `Unoptimized` function in `src/loop_carried_dependency.cpp`) is shown below.

```
double sum = 0;
for (size_t i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (size_t j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    sum += a[i * N + j];
  }
  sum += b[i];
}
result[0] = sum;
```
In the unoptimized kernel, a sum is computed over two loops.  The inner loop sums over the `a` data and the outer loop over the `b` data. Since the value `sum` updates in both loops, this introduces a _loop carried dependency_ that causes the outer loop to be serialized. It allows only one invocation of the outer loop to be active at a time, which reduces performance.

A snippet of the optimized code (the `Optimized` function in `src/loop_carried_dependency.cpp`) is given below, which removes the loop carried dependency on the `sum` variable.

```
double sum = 0;

for (size_t i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  // Step 1: Definition
  double sum_2 = 0;

  // Step 2: Accumulation of array A values for one outer loop iteration
  for (size_t j = 0; j < N; j++) {
    sum_2 += a[i * N + j];
  }

  // Step 3: Addition of array B value for an outer loop iteration
  sum += sum_2;
  sum += b[i];
}

result[0] = sum;
```

The optimized kernel demonstrates the use of an independent variable `sum_2` that is not updated in the outer loop and removes the need to serialize the outer loop, which improves the performance.

### When to Use This Technique

Look at the _Compiler Report > Throughput Analysis > Loop Analysis_ section in the reports. The report lists the II and details for each loop. The technique presented in this tutorial may be applicable if the _Brief Info_ of the loop shows _Serial exe: Data dependency_.  The details pane may provide more information.

```
* Iteration executed serially across _function.block_. Only a single loop iteration will execute inside this region due to data dependency on variable(s):
    * sum (_filename:line_)
```

## Build the `Remove Loop Carried Dependency` Sample

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

   > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
   >  ```
   >
   > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
   >  ```
   >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
   >
   > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate HTML performance report.
      ```
      make report
      ```
      The report resides at `loop_carried_dependency_report.prj/reports/report.html`.

      (Optional) Navigate to the _Loops Analysis_ view of the report (under _Throughput Analysis_) and observe that the loop in block `UnOptKernel.B1` is showing _Serial exe: Data dependency_.  Click the *source location* field in the table to see the details for the loop. It should show 1 as the maximum interleaving iteration of the loop, as the loop is serialized. Now, observe that the loop in block `OptKernel.B1` is not marked as *Serialized*. It shows 12 as the maximum Interleaving iterations of the loop.

   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga
      ```

### On Windows*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for the Agilex® 7 device family, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```

  > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
  >  ```
  >
  > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
  >  ```
  >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
  >  ```
  > **Note**: You can poll your system for available BSPs using the `aoc -list-boards` command. The board list that is printed out will be of the form
  > ```
  > $> aoc -list-boards
  > Board list:
  >   <board-variant>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  >   <board-variant2>
  >      Board Package: <path/to/board/package>/board-support-package
  > ```
  >
  > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate HTML performance report.
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
      The report resides at `loop_carried_dependency.prj.a/reports/report.html`.

      (Optional) Navigate to the _Loops Analysis_ view of the report (under _Throughput Analysis_) and observe that the loop in block `UnOptKernel.B1` is showing _Serial exe: Data dependency_.  Click the *source location* field in the table to see the details for the loop. It should show 1 as the maximum interleaving iteration of the loop, as the loop is serialized. Now, observe that the loop in block `OptKernel.B1` is not marked as *Serialized*. It shows 12 as the maximum Interleaving iterations of the loop.

   3. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```

>**Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your `build` directory in a shorter path, for example `C:\samples\build`. You can then build the sample in the new location, but you must specify the full path to the build files.

## Example Output

### Example Output on FPGA Device

>**Note**: In the sample, applying the optimization yields a total execution time reduction by almost a factor of 4. The Initiation Interval (II) for the inner loop is 12 because a double floating point add takes 11 cycles on the FPGA.
