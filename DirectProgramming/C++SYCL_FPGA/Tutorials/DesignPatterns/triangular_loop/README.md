## Key Implementation Details

The sample illustrates the following important concepts:

- The triangular loop advanced optimization technique and situations where it works best.
- The use of `ivdep safelen` to convey the broken loop-carried dependency to the compiler.

### Triangular Loops Explained

A triangular loop is a loop nest where the inner-loop range depends on the outer loop variable in such a way that the inner-loop trip-count shrinks or grows. This is best explained with an example:

```c++
  for (int x = 0; x < n; x++) {
    for (int y = x + 1; y < n; y++) {
      local_buf[y] = local_buf[y] + SomethingComplicated(local_buf[x]);
    }
  }
```

In this example, the inner-loop executes fewer and fewer iterations as overall execution progresses. Each iteration of the inner-loop performs a read from index `[x]` and a read-modify-write on indices `[y]=x+1` to `[y]=n-1`. Expressed graphically (with *n*=10), these operations look like:

```c++
    y=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
==========================
x=0   o x x x x x x x x x
x=1     o x x x x x x x x
x=2       o x x x x x x x
x=3         o x x x x x x
x=4           o x x x x x
x=5             o x x x x
x=6               o x x x
x=7                 o x x
x=8                   o x
x=9

Legend: read="o", read-modify-write="x"
```

The picture is triangular in shape, hence the name "triangular loop".

### Performance Challenge

In the above example, the table shows that in outer-loop iteration `x=0`, the program reads `local_buf[x=0]` and reads, modifies, and writes the values from `local_buf[y=1]` through `local_buf[y=9]`. This pattern of memory accesses results in a loop-carried dependency across the outer loop iterations. For example, the read at `x=2` depends on the value written at `x=1,y=2`.

Generally, a new iteration is launched on every cycle as long as a sufficient number of inner-loop
iterations are executed *between* any two iterations that are dependent on one another.

However, the challenge in the triangular loop pattern is that the trip-count of the inner-loop
progressively shrinks as `x` increments. In the worst case of `x=7`, the program writes to `local_buf[y=8]` in the first `y` iteration but has only one intervening `y` iteration at `y=9` before the value must be reread at `x=8,y=8`. This may not allow enough time for the write operation to complete. The compiler compensates for this by increasing the initiation interval (II) of the inner-loop to allow more time to elapse between iterations. Unfortunately, this reduces the throughput of the inner-loop by a factor of II.

A key observation is that this increased II is only functionally necessary when the inner-loop trip-count becomes small. Furthermore, the II of a loop is static: it applies to all invocations of that loop. Therefore, if the *outer-loop* trip-count (*n*) is large, most of the inner-loop invocations unnecessarily suffer the previously mentioned throughput degradation. The optimization technique demonstrated in this tutorial addresses this issue.

### Optimization Concept

The triangular loop optimization alters the code to guarantee that the trip count never falls below some minimum (*M*). This is accomplished by executing extra 'dummy' iterations of the inner loop when the *true* trip count falls below *M*.

The purpose of the dummy iterations is to allow extra time for the loop-carried dependency to resolve. No actual computation (or side effects) takes place during these added iterations. Note that the extra iterations are only executed on inner loop invocations that require them. When the inner-loop trip count is large, extra iterations are not needed.

This technique allows the compiler to achieve II=1.

Applying the triangular loop optimization to the original example, the post-optimization execution graph for *M*=6 (with *n*=10) appears as follows:

```c++
    y=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
==========================
x=0   o x x x x x x x x x
x=1     o x x x x x x x x
x=2       o x x x x x x x
x=3         o x x x x x x
x=4           o x x x x x
x=5           - o x x x x
x=6           - - o x x x
x=7           - - - o x x
x=8           - - - - o x
x=9
              <---M=6--->

Legend: read="o", read-modify-write="x", dummy iteration="-"
```

### Selecting the Value of *M*

The objective is to find the minimal value of *M* that enables the compiler to achieve an II of 1. Any value of *M* larger than this minimum adds unnecessary latency to the computation.

A good starting point of the value of *M* is the II of the unoptimized inner loop, which can be found in the "Loop Analysis" report of the unoptimized code. If the compiler can achieve II=1 with this starting value, experiment with reducing *M* until II increases. If the compiler does not achieve II=1, increase *M* until it does. This search for the optimal *M* can be done quickly, as the compiler takes little time to generate the static optimization report.

### Applying the Optimization in Code

Here is the triangular loop optimization of the original code snippet:

```c++
// Indices to track the execution in the merged loop
int x = 0, y = 1;

// Total iterations of the merged loop
const int loop_bound = TotalIterations(M, n);

[[intelfpga::ivdep(M)]]
for (int i = 0; i < loop_bound; i++) {

  // Determine if this is a real or dummy iteration
  bool compute = y > x;
  if (compute) {
    local_buf[y] = local_buf[y] + SomethingComplicated(local_buf[x]);
  }

  y++;
  if (y == n) {
    x++;
    y = Min(n - M, x + 1);
  }
}
```
This requires some explanation!

**Single loop:** Notice that the original nested loop has been manually coalesced or "merged" into a single loop. The explicit `x` and `y` induction variables are employed to achieve the triangular iteration pattern. The actual computation inside the loop is guarded by the condition `y > x`.

**Merged loop trip count:** The total trip-count of this merged loop is `loop_bound` in the snippet . The value of `loop_bound` is the total number of iterations in the execution graph diagram, which is a function of *n* and *M*.

To derive the expression for `TotalIterations(M, n)`, consider the iterations as consisting of the following two triangles of "real" and "dummy" iterations.

```c++
    y=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9                     y=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
=========================                 =========================
x=0   o x x x x x x x x x                 x=0
x=1     o x x x x x x x x                 x=1
x=2       o x x x x x x x                 x=2
x=3         o x x x x x x                 x=3
x=4           o x x x x x       +         x=4
x=5             o x x x x                 x=5           -
x=6               o x x x                 x=6           - -
x=7                 o x x                 x=7           - - -
x=8                   o x                 x=8           - - - -
x=9
                                                        <(M-2)>
                                                        <---M=6--->
```
The number of "real" iterations on the left is 10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2 = 54. The formula for a
descending series from `n` is `n*(n+1)/2`. Since there is no iteration at `x=9,y=9`, subtract 1  (for example, `n*(n+1)/2 - 1`). When *n*=10, the expression will yield 54 as expected.

The number of dummy iterations on the right is 4+3+2+1 = 10. The largest number in this series is *M*-2. Using the same formula for a descending series , you get `(M-2)*(M-1)/2`. For *M*=6, this expression will yield 4*5/2 = 10 as expected.

Summing the number of real and dummy iterations gives the total iterations of the merged loop.

**Use of ivdep**: Since the loop is restructured to ensure that a minimum of M iterations is executed, the `[[intelfpga::ivdep(M)]]` is used to hint to the compiler that at least *M* iterations always separate any pair of dependent iterations.

## Build the `Triangular Loop` Sample

>**Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
