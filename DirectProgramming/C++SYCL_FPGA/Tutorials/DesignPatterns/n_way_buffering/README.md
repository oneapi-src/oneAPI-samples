# `N-Way Buffering` Sample

The `N-Way Buffering` sample is an FPGA tutorial that demonstrates how to parallelize host-side processing and buffer transfers between host and device with kernel execution to improve overall application performance. N-Way buffering is a generalization of the double buffering optimization technique (see the *Double Buffering* FPGA tutorial). You can use this approach to perform this overlap when the host-processing time exceeds kernel execution time.

## Key Implementation Details

This sample covers the following key concepts:

- The N-way buffering optimization technique as a generalization of double buffering
- Determining when N-way buffering is practical and beneficial
- How to measure the impact of N-way buffering

In an application where the FPGA kernel is executed multiple-times, the host must perform the following processing and buffer transfers before each kernel invocation:

1. The output data from the *previous* invocation must be transferred from the device to the host and then processed by the host. Examples of this processing include the following:
   - Copying the data to another location.
   - Rearranging the data.
   - Verifying the data.

2. The input data for the *next* invocation must be processed by the host and then transferred to the device. Examples of this processing include:
   - Copying the data from another location.
   - Rearranging the data for kernel consumption.
   - Generating the data.

Without the technique described in this tutorial, host processing and buffer transfers occur **between** kernel executions. There is a gap in time between kernel executions, which you can refer to as kernel **downtime** (see the image below). If these operations overlap with kernel execution, the kernels can execute back-to-back with minimal downtime increasing overall application performance.

### N-Way Buffering

This technique is referred to as *N-Way Buffering*,  but is frequently called *double buffering* in the most common case where N=2. Before proceeding, it is important to define some variables:

| Variable | Description
|:--       |:--
| **R**    | Time to transfer the kernel's output buffer from device to host.
| **Op**   | Host-side processing time of kernel output data (*output processing*).
| **Ip**   | Host-side processing time for kernel input data (*input processing*).
| **W**    | Time to transfer the kernel's input buffer from host to device.
| **K**    | Kernel execution time.
| **N**    | Number of buffer sets used.
| **C**    | Number of host-side CPU cores.


![](assets/downtime.png)


In general, the **R**, **Op**, **Ip**, and **W** operations must all complete before the next kernel is launched. To maximize performance, while one kernel is executing on the device, these operations should run in parallel and operate on a separate set of buffer locations. You should complete before the current kernel completes, thus allowing the next kernel to be launched immediately with no downtime. In general, to maximize performance, the host must launch a new kernel every **K**.

If these host-side operations are executed serially, this leads to the following constraint:

```
R + Op + Ip + W <= K, to minimize kernel downtime.
```

In the above example, if the constraint is satisfied, the application requires two sets of buffers. In this case, **N**=2.

However, the above constraint may not be satisfied in some applications (i.e., if host-processing takes longer than the kernel execution time).

>**Note**: A performance improvement may still be observed because kernel downtime may still be reduced (though perhaps not maximally reduced).

Improve performance by reducing host-processing time through multi-threading. Rather than executing the above operations serially, perform the input- and output-processing operations in parallel using two threads, leading to the following constraint:

```
Max (R+Op, Ip+W) <= K
and
R + W <= K, to minimize kernel downtime.
````

If the above constraint is still unsatisfied, the technique can be extended beyond two sets of buffers to **N** sets of buffers to help improve the degree of overlap. In this case, the constraint becomes:

```
Max (R + Op, Ip + W) <= (N-1)*K
and
R + W <= K, to minimize kernel downtime.
```

The idea of N-way buffering is to prepare **N** sets of kernel input buffers, launch **N** kernels, and when the first kernel completes, begin the subsequent host-side operations. These operations may take a long time (longer than **K**), but they do not cause kernel downtime because an additional **N**-1 kernels have already been queued and can launch immediately. By the time these first **N** kernels complete, the  host-side operations previously mentioned would have also completed, and the **N**+1 kernel can be launched with no downtime. As additional kernels complete, corresponding host-side operations are launched on the host, using multiple threads in a parallel fashion. Although the host operations take longer than **K**, if **N** is chosen correctly, they will complete with a period of **K**, which is required to ensure we can launch a new kernel every **K**. To reiterate, this scheme requires multi-threaded host-operations because the host must perform processing for up to **N** kernels in parallel to keep up.

The above formula can be used to calculate the **N** required to minimize downtime. However, there are some practical limits:

- **N** sets of buffers are required on both the host and device. Therefore both must have the capacity for this many buffers.
- If the input and output processing operations are launched in separate threads, then (**N**-1)*2 cores are required so that **C** can become the limiting factor.

### Measuring the Impact of N-Way Buffering

You must get a sense of the kernel downtime to identify the degree to which this technique can help improve performance.

This can be done by querying the total kernel execution time from the runtime and comparing it to the overall application execution time. In an application where kernels execute with minimal downtime, these two numbers are close. However, if kernels have significant downtime, overall execution time notably exceeds the kernel execution time. The tutorial code demonstrates how to do this.

### Implementation Notes

The example code runs with multiple iterations to illustrate how performance improves as **N** increases and as multi-threading is used.

It is useful to think of the execution space as having **N** slots where the slots execute in chronological order, and each slot has its own set of buffers on the host and device. At the beginning of execution, the host prepares the kernel input data for the **N** slots and launches **N** kernels. When slot-0 completes, slot-1 begins executing immediately because it was already queued. The host begins both the output and input processing for slot-0. These two operations must complete before the host can queue another kernel into slot-0. The same is true for all slots.

After each kernel is launched, the host-side operations (that occur *after* the kernel in that slot completes) are launched immediately from the `main()` program. They block until the kernel execution for that slot completes (this is enforced by the runtime).

## Build the `N-Way Buffering` Sample

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\"Program Files (x86)"\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

>In all runs, the total kernel execution time is similar as expected. In the first three configurations, the overall execution time exceeds the total kernel execution time, implying there is downtime between kernel executions. However, as we switch from single-threaded to multi-threaded host operations and increase the number of buffer sets used, the overall execution time approaches the kernel execution time.
