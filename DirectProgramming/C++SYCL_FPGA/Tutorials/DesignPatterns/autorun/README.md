# `Autorun Kernels` Sample

This `Autorun Kernels` sample is a tutorial that demonstrates how to create the equivalent of OpenCL `autorun` kernels in oneAPI. An autorun kernel is one that is submitted before the `main()` function begins, and typically (though not necessarily) never finishes.

## Purpose

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to create autorun kernels in SYCL*-compliant code. Autorun kernels are submitted to the SYCL queue automatically before `main()` begins and are meant to have no direct interaction with the host. This means that they should not directly access global memory (for example, through USM pointers or SYCL accessors) and the host should not wait for them to finish.

## Prerequisites

| Optimized for      | Description
|:---                |:---
| OS                 | Ubuntu* 18.04/20.04 <br> RHEL*/CentOS* 8 <br> SUSE* 15 <br> Windows* 10
| Hardware           | Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card (PAC) with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA <br> FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card (PAC) D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX)
| Software           | Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler

> **Note**: Even though the Intel DPC++/C++ OneAPI compiler is enough to compile for emulation, generating reports and generating RTL, there are extra software requirements for the simulation flow and FPGA compiles.
>
> For using the simulator flow, one of the following simulators must be installed and accessible through your PATH:
> - Questa*-Intel® FPGA Edition
> - Questa*-Intel® FPGA Starter Edition
> - ModelSim® SE
>
> When using the hardware compile flow, Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition must be installed and accessible through your PATH.

>**Note**: Intel® FPGA PAC hardware is only compatible with Ubuntu 18.04*.

## Key Implementation Details

This sample demonstrates the following concepts:

- How to use the autorun kernel header file (`autorun.hpp`).
- When it is appropriate to use autorun kernels.

Typically, these kernels are meant to run forever, and data is streamed to and from them using SYCL pipes. This technique is illustrated in the figures below where the middle light-blue kernels (`ARKernel` and `ARForeverKernel`) are autorun kernels, and the dark-blue kernels on the left and right are regular SYCL kernels. The images below correspond to the `Autorun` and `AutorunForever` kernels used in this tutorial. See the comments and code in `autorun.cpp` for more details on the differences.

## Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

## Build the `Autorun Kernels` Sample

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see *[Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html)* or *[Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html)*.

### Use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 1. Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 2. Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 3. Open a terminal in VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**).
 4. Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see the *[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html)*.


### On Linux*

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for **Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA**, which is the default.

   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   ```
   For **Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX)**, enter the following:
   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   For a custom FPGA platform, ensure that the board support package is installed on your system then enter a command similar to the following:

   ```
   cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate HTML performance report.
      ```
      make report
      ```
      The report resides at `autorun_report.prj/reports/report.html`.

   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      make fpga
      ```


### On Windows*

>**Note**: The Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA and Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX) do not yet support Windows*. Compiling to FPGA hardware on Windows* requires a third-party or custom Board Support Package (BSP) with Windows* support.

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program for **Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA**, which is the default.
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
   ```
   To compile for the **Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX)**, enter the following:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10
   ```
   For a custom FPGA platform, ensure that the board support package is installed on your system then enter a command similar to the following:
   ```
   cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
   ```

3. Compile the design. (The provided targets match the recommended development flow.)

   1. Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_emu
      ```
   2. Generate HTML performance report.
      ```
      nmake report
      ```
      The report resides at `autorun_report.prj.a/reports/report.html`.

   3. Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga_sim
      ```
   4. Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device).
      ```
      nmake fpga
      ```
>**Note**: If you encounter any issues with long paths when compiling under Windows*, you may have to create your ‘build’ directory in a shorter path, for example `C:\samples\build`. You can then run cmake from that directory, and provide cmake with the full path to your sample directory.

## Run the `Autorun Kernels` Sample

### On Linux

1. Run the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
   ```
   ./autorun.fpga_emu
   ```
2. Run on the FPGA simulator.
   ```
   ./autorun.fpga_sim
   ```
3. Run on an FPGA device.
   ```
   ./autorun.fpga
   ```

### On Windows

1. Run the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU).
   ```
   set SYCL_ENABLE_DEFAULT_CONTEXTS=1
   autorun.fpga_emu.exe
   ```
   >**Note**: You must set the `SYCL_ENABLE_DEFAULT_CONTEXTS=1` environment variable or the program will hang.

2. Run on the FPGA simulator.
   ```
   autorun.fpga_sim.exe
   ```
3. Run on an FPGA device.
   ```
   autorun.fpga.exe
   ```

### Build and Run the Samples on Intel® DevCloud (Optional)

When running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode.

>**Note**: Since Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI includes the appropriate development environment already configured, you do not need to set environment variables.

Use the Linux instructions to build and run the program.

You can specify an FPGA runtime node using a single line script similar to the following example.

```
qsub -I -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2 -d .
```

- `-I` (upper case I) requests an interactive session.
- `-l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2` (lower case L) assigns one full node.
- `-d .` makes the current folder as the working directory for the task.

  |Available Nodes           |Command Options
  |:---                      |:---
  |FPGA Compile Time         |`qsub -l nodes=1:fpga_compile:ppn=2 -d .`
  |FPGA Runtime (Arria 10)   |`qsub -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:arria10:ppn=2 -d .`
  |FPGA Runtime (Stratix 10) |`qsub -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:stratix10:ppn=2 -d .`
  |GPU	                     |`qsub -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 -d .`
  |CPU	                     |`qsub -l nodes=1:xeon:ppn=2 -d .`

>**Note**: For more information on how to specify compute nodes read, *[Launch and manage jobs](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/job-submission/)* in the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI Documentation.

Only `fpga_compile` nodes support compiling to FPGA. When compiling for FPGA hardware, increase the job timeout to **12 hours**.

Executing programs on FPGA hardware is only supported on `fpga_runtime` nodes of the appropriate type, such as `fpga_runtime:arria10` or `fpga_runtime:stratix10`.

Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI *[Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/)* page.
