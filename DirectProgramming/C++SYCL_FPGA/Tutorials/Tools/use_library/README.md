> **Note**: Even though the Intel DPC++/C++ OneAPI compiler is enough to compile for emulation, generating reports and generating RTL, there are extra software requirements for the simulation flow and FPGA compiles.
>
> For using the simulator flow, Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition and one of the following simulators must be installed and accessible through your PATH:
> - Questa*-Intel® FPGA Edition
> - Questa*-Intel® FPGA Starter Edition
> - ModelSim® SE
>
> When using the hardware compile flow, Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro Edition must be installed and accessible through your PATH.
>
> :warning: Make sure you add the device files associated with the FPGA that you are targeting to your Intel® Quartus® Prime installation.


> :warning: When targeting an IP-only flow, the RTL library feature will not work when compiling to Quartus and will error out in the late-stage compile. RTL libraries will work in the simulation flow. This will be fixed in a future release. This is documented in the [compiler release notes](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/release-notes/intel-oneapi-dpc-c-compiler-release-notes.html).

## Purpose

This FPGA tutorial demonstrates how to build SYCL device libraries from RTL sources and use them in your SYCL design. An RTL library is useful for embedding high performance FPGA code, handwritten in Verilog into your oneAPI program.

### Generating a library

To create a library from  source code, use the following steps:

1. `fpga_crossgen` creates object file that contains representations for target devices (FPGA) and FPGA emulator. The following command instructs `fpga_crossgen` to generate SYCL target objects from an RTL source in this tutorial:

   ```bash
   # Linux
   fpga_crossgen lib_rtl_spec.xml --emulation_model lib_rtl_model.cpp --target sycl -o lib_rtl.o

   # Windows
   fpga_crossgen lib_rtl_spec.xml --emulation_model lib_rtl_model.cpp --target sycl -o lib_rtl.obj
   ```

   Note that generating an RTL library requires that an `xml` file and a C++ emulation model be provided in addition to the Verilog source code. The RTL is used when compiling for the hardware whereas the emulation model is used when the oneAPI program is run on the FPGA emulator. Examine the tutorial source code and the comments in `use_library.cpp` for more details.

2. `fpga_libtool` collects one or more objects into a SYCL library archive file. This command creates a single library archive file from one or more object files generated by `fpga_crossgen` in the previous step:

   ```bash
   # Linux
   fpga_libtool lib_rtl.o --target sycl --create lib.a

   # Windows
   fpga_libtool lib_rtl.obj --target sycl --create lib.lib

   ```

### Using the library

To use the generated library in your project, simply add the generated library archive file to the list of input source files when invoking `icpx`. To compile the `use_library` tutorial, pass both `use_library.cpp` and `lib.a` as inputs.

```bash
# Compile for FPGA emulator
icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga use_library.cpp lib.a -o use_library_emu.fpga -DFPGA_EMULATOR

# Compile for FPGA Simulator
icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga use_library.cpp lib.a -o use_library.fpga -Xssimulation -DFPGA_SIMULATOR

# Compile for FPGA hardware
icpx -fsycl -fintelfpga use_library.cpp lib.a -o use_library.fpga -Xshardware -DFPGA_HARDWARE
```

## Building the `use_library` Tutorial

> **Note**: When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
> Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation every time you open a new terminal window.
> This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### On a Linux* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

    To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake ..
    ```

    > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
    >  ```
    >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
    >  ```
    >
    > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
    >  ```
    >  cmake .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
    >  ```
    >
    > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   * Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

      ```bash
      make fpga_emu
      ```

   * Generate the optimization report:

     ```bash
     make report
     ```

   * Compile for FPGA Simulator

     ```bash
     make fpga_sim
     ```

   * Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```bash
     make fpga
     ```

### On a Windows* System

1. Generate the `Makefile` by running `cmake`.

    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

    To compile for the default target (the Agilex® 7 device family), run `cmake` using the command:
    ```
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
    ```
    > **Note**: You can change the default target by using the command:
    >  ```
    >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<FPGA device family or FPGA part number>
    >  ```
    >
    > Alternatively, you can target an explicit FPGA board variant and BSP by using the following command:
    >  ```
    >  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" .. -DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>
    >  ```
    >
    > You will only be able to run an executable on the FPGA if you specified a BSP.

2. Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

   - Compile for emulation (fast compile time, targets emulated FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga_emu
     ```

   - Generate the optimization report:

     ```
     nmake report
     ```

   - Compile for simulation (fast compile time, targets simulated FPGA device, reduced problem size):

     ```
     nmake fpga_sim
     ```

   - Compile for FPGA hardware (longer compile time, targets FPGA device):

     ```
     nmake fpga
     ```

## Running the Sample

1. Run the sample on the FPGA emulator (the kernel executes on the CPU):

     ```bash
     ./use_library.fpga_emu     (Linux)
     use_library.fpga_emu.exe   (Windows)
     ```

2. Run the sample on the FPGA simulator device

    * On Linux
        ```bash
        CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1 ./use_library.fpga_sim
        ```
    * On Windows
        ```bash
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=1
        use_library.fpga_sim.exe
        set CL_CONTEXT_MPSIM_DEVICE_INTELFPGA=
        ```

3. Run the sample on the FPGA device (only if you ran `cmake` with `-DFPGA_DEVICE=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>`):

     ```bash
     ./use_library.fpga         (Linux)
     use_library.fpga.exe       (Windows)
     ```
