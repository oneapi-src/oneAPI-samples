# oneAPI Samples for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)

The folders in this area of the oneAPI-sample GitHub repository include tutorials, reference designs, and libraries specific to field programmable gate array (FPGA) features.

You will need the following toolkits and add-ons:

- [Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit (Base Kit)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit.html), specifically the Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler.
- [Intel® FPGA Add-On for oneAPI Base Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fpga.html).
- Optionally, you might need access to [Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/).

>**Note**: The latest versions of code samples on the master branch are not guaranteed to be stable. Use a [stable release version](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tags) of the repository that corresponds to the version of the compiler you are using.

### Understand FPGA Programming

The *Introduction To FPGA Design Concepts* section of the [FPGA Optimization Guide for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-fpga-optimization-guide) contains information on the basic concepts that are foundational to FPGA programming. Read that section to get the most from these FPGA samples.

## Build and Run the Samples on Local Development System

Each sample contains a `README.md` file with instructions to build and run the sample. The following sections contain information about configuring your development environment to build and run the samples; in most cases, the sample `README.md` file contains specific instructions.

### Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables.
Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window.
This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

>**Note**: For more information on configuring environment variables, see [Use the setvars Script with Linux* or macOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html) or [Use the setvars Script with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Include Files

The FPGA samples use many of the headers in the [`DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/include`](/DirectProgramming/C++SYCL_FPGA/include) folder.

### Use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code* (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 1. Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 2. Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**.
 3. Open a terminal in VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**).
 4. Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using instructions for Linux.
 5. (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the Generate Launch Configurations extension.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see the 
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).


### Use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You can compile and run the sample using the Eclipse* IDE (Linux*) and Microsoft Visual Studio* (Windows*). For  on using the IDE integration, see [FPGA Workflows on Third-Party IDEs for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-workflow-on-ide.html).


### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs when compiling a sample, you can get more details by running `make` with the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``

If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the [Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html) for more information on using the utility.

## Performance Disclaimers

Tests document performance of components on a particular test, in specific systems and may not reflect all publicly available security updates. 
Differences in hardware, software, or configuration will affect actual performance. 
Consult other sources of information to evaluate performance as you consider your purchase. 
For complete information about performance and benchmark results, visit [this page](https://edc.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/performance/benchmarks/overview).
See configuration disclosure for details.
No product or component can be absolutely secure.

Intel technologies’ features and benefits depend on system configuration and may require enabled hardware, software, or service activation. Performance varies depending on system configuration. Check with your system manufacturer or retailer or learn more at [intel.com](https://www.intel.com).

## Build and Run the Samples on Intel® DevCloud (Optional)

When running a sample in the Intel® DevCloud, you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode.

You can specify a FPGA runtime node using a single line script similar to the following example.

```
qsub -I -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2 -d .
```

- `-I` (upper case I) requests an interactive session.
- `-l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2` (lower case L) assigns one full node.
- `-d .` makes the current folder as the working directory for the task.

  |Available Nodes    |Command Options
  |:---               |:---
  |FPGA Compile Time  |`qsub -I -l nodes=1:fpga_compile:ppn=2 -d .`
  |FPGA Runtime       |`qsub -I -l nodes=1:fpga_runtime:ppn=2 -d .`
  |GPU                |`qsub -I -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 -d .`
  |CPU                |`qsub -I -l nodes=1:xeon:ppn=2 -d .`

>**Note**: For more information on how to specify compute nodes read, [Launch and manage jobs](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/job-submission/) in the Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI Documentation.

Only `fpga_compile` nodes support compiling to FPGA. When compiling for FPGA hardware, increase the job timeout to 24 hours.

Neither compiling nor executing programs on FPGA hardware are supported on the login nodes. For more information, see the [Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/documentation/base-toolkit/).

>**Note**: Since Intel® DevCloud for oneAPI includes the appropriate development environment already configured for you, you do not need to set environment variables.
