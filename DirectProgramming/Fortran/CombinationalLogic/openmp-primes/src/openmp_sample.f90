! [DESCRIPTION]
! This code finds all primes in the first 40,000,000 integers, the number of
! 4n+1 primes, and the number of 4n-1 primes in the same range.
!
! This source illustrates two OpenMP directives to help speed up 
! the code.  First, a dynamic "schedule" clause is used with the OpenMP "for"
! directive. Because the "for" loop's workload increases as its index
! gets bigger, the default "static" scheduling does not work well.
! Instead dynamic scheduling is used to account for the increasing
! workload.  But dynamic scheduling itself has more overhead than
! static scheduling, so a "chunk size" of 10 is used to reduce the
! overhead for dynamic scheduling.  Second, a "reduction" clause is
! used instead of an OpenMP "critical" directive to eliminate lock overhead.
! A "critical" directive would cause excessive lock overhead due to 
! the one-thread-at-time update of the shared variables each 
! time through the "for" loop.  Instead the reduction clause causes only
! one update of the shared variables once at the end of the loop.
!
! [COMPILE] 
! Use the following compiler options to compile both multi- and 
! single-threaded versions. 
!
! Parallel compilation:
!
!   Windows*: /Qopenmp /fpp 
!
!   Linux* and macOS*: -qopenmp -fpp 
!
! Serial compilation:
!
!   Use the same command, but omit the -fopenmp (Linux* and macOS*)
!   or /Qopenmp (Windows) option.
