You also should have already went through the  [Introduction to OpenMP Offload module](../intro/intro_f.ipynb) and [Managing Device Data module](../datatransfer/datatransfer_f.ipynb), where the basics of using the Jupyter notebooks with the Intel® DevCloud and an introduction to the OpenMP `target` and `map` constructs were discussed."

    "## What is Unified Shared Memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unified Shared Memory (USM) is a tool for data management currently supported by the Intel&reg; Fortran Compiler. USM __simplifies development__ for the programmer when __porting existing code__ to support OpenMP Offload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Developer View of USM\n",
    "\n",
    "The picture below shows __developer view of memory__ without USM and with USM. \n",
    "\n",
    "With USM, the developer can reference that same memory object in host and device code.  \n",

    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Allocating Unified Shared Memory\n",
    "In the previous modules, we used the `map` clause with the `target`, `target data`, and `target enter/exit data` pragmas which enabled the mapping of memory between host and device data environments. However, we can also use OpenMP USM routines to simplify the management of host and device memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of USM\n",
    "\n",
    "USM provides different types of memory to allow both explicit and implicit models for managing memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Device memory can be allocated for explicit user control of data movement. Host and shared memory are provided to allow implicit accesses from the accelerator device.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following table illustrates the properties of the different USM memories and how they can be allocated. The allocate directive needs to be used prior to the allocate command.\n",
