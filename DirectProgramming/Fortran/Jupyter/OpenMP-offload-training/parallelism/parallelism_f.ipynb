EUs are compute processors that drive the SIMD ALUs.\n",

    "## \"Normal\" OpenMP constructs\n",
    "OpenMP GPU offload support all \"normal\" OpenMP constructs such as `parallel`, `do`, `barrier`, `sections`, `tasks`, etc. However, not every construct will be useful for the GPU. When using these constructs, the full threading model is only supported with in a subslice, this is because there's no synchronization among subslices, and there's no coherence and memory fence among subslices' L1 caches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's examine the following example.\n",
    "```fortran\n",
    "subroutine saxpy(a, x, y, sz)\n",
    "    ! Declarations Omitted\n",
    "    !$omp target map(to:x(1:sz)) map(tofrom(y(1:sz))\n",

    "    !$omp end target\n",
    "end subroutine\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, we use the `target` pragma to offload the execution to the GPU. We then use `parallel` to create a team of threads, `do` to distribute loop iterations to those threads, and `simd` to request iteration vectorization with SIMD instructions. However, due to the restrictions aforementioned, only one GPU subslice is utilized here, so the GPU would be significantly underutilized. In some cases, the compiler may deduce `team distribute` from `parallel for` and still use the entire GPU."

    "To take advantage of multiple subslices, use the `teams` pragma to create multiple **master** threads for execution. When combined with the `parallel` pragma, these master threads become a league of thread teams. Becuase there's no synchronization across teams of threads, the teams could then be assigned to different GPU subslices.\n",

    "<img src=\"Assets/teams.JPG\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the `teams` construct, the number of teams created is implementation defined. Although, you may optionally specify an upper limit with the **num_teams** clause. The **thread_limit** clause of the `teams` pragma can be optionally used to limit the number of threads in each team.\n",

    "## Worksharing with Teams\n",
    "After a league of teams is created by `teams`, use the `distribute` construct to distribute chunks of iterations of a loop across the different teams in the league. This is analogous to what the `do` construct does for `parallel` regions. The `distribute` pragma is associated with a loop nest inside a teams region.\n",
    "\n",
    "For nested loops, the **collapse** clause can be used to specify how many loops are associated with the `distribute` pragma. You may specify a **collapse** clause with a parameter value greater than 1 to collapse associated loops into one large loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use **dist_schedule** clause on the `distribute` construct to manually specify the chunk size that are distributed to master threads of each team. For example, `!$omp distribute dist_schedule(static, 512)` would create chunks of 512 iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with Combined Constructs\n",
    "For convenience, OpenMP supports combined constructs for OpenMP offload. The code below shows how a single line can encompass all of the directives that we've discussed.\n",

    "end subroutine\n",
    "```\n",
    "When these constructs are used without additional clauses, the number of teams created, the number of threads created per team, and how loop iterations are distributed are all implementation defined.\n",
    "The following diagram breaks down the effects of each pragma in the previous example. Here we assume that there are a total of 128 loop iterations and that 4 teams, and 4 threads per team are created by the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `omp target` pragma offloads the execution to device\n",
    "2. The `omp teams` pragma creates multiple master threads, 4 thread teams in this diagram.\n",
    "3. The `omp distribute` pragma distributes loop iterations to those 4 thread teams, 32 threads for each team shown.\n",
    "4. The `omp parallel` pragma creates a team of threads for each master thread (team), 4 threads created for each team shown.\n",
    "5. The `omp do` pragma distributes the 32 iterations to each of the 4 threads.\n",
    "6. The `omp simd` pragma specifies that multiple iterations of the loop can be executed using SIMD instructions.\n",
