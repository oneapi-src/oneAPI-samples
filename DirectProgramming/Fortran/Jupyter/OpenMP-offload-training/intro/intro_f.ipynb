    "## HPC Single-Node Workflow with oneAPI \n",
    "Accelerated code can be written in either kernel (SYCL) or __directive-based__ (OpenMP) style. __CUDA*__ evelopers can use the __Intel® DPC++ Compatibility tool__ to perform a one-time migration from __CUDA*__ to __SYCL__. Existing __Fortran__ and C applications can use OpenMP__ offload constructs. Existing __C++__ applications can choose either the __Kernel style__ or the __directive-based style option__ and existing __OpenCL__ applications can remain in the OpenCL language or migrate to SYCL.\n",

    "## OpenMP vs SYCL\n",
    "Both OpenMP and SYCL are open standards that can be used to accelerate algorithms on GPUs. As the workflow diagram shows, oneAPI supports both methodologies and you should be able to achieve similar optimized performance with either option. The decision between the two choices likely depends on workflow requirements and ease of porting. When migrating from existing __CUDA__ or __OpenCL__ projects, SYCL would likely make more sense. When migrating from existing C/Fortran applications with __OpenMP__, then OpenMP offload would be the easier alternative.\n",

    "## OpenMP Offload\n",
    "**OpenMP Offload** constructs are a set of directives for C++ and Fortran introduced in OpenMP 4.0 and further enhanced in later versions that allows developers to offload data and execution to target accelerators such as GPUs. OpenMP offload is supported in the Intel® oneAPI HPC Toolkit with the Intel® C++ Compiler and the Intel® Fortran Compiler."
