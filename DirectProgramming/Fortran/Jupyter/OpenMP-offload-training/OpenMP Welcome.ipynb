    "### [Fortran](intro/intro_f.ipynb)\n",
    "The Bootstrapping hands-on exercise introduces the developers to OpenMP offload and getting \"feet wet\" with the tools.  Further, it familiarizes developers with the use of Jupyter notebooks as a front-end for all training exercises.  This workshop is enabled for training on the DevCloud and includes material from [Using Intel® DevCloud with oneAPI Products](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/using-intel-devcloud-with-oneapi-products \"Using DPC++ on the DevCloud\") on how to submit batch jobs.\n",

    "### [Fortran](datatransfer/datatransfer_f.ipynb)\n",
    "In this hands-on lab the developer will use various OpenMP directives to minimize data transfers between the CPU  host and the GPU target device.\n",

    "## Module 3- Utilizing GPU Parallelism\n",
    "### [Fortran](parallelism/parallelism_f.ipynb)\n",
    "In this lab we will attempt to use various OpenMP constructs to maximize parallelism and performance when offloading to GPUs. \n",
