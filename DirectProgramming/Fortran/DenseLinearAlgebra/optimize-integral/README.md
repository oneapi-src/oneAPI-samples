# `Optimization Integral` Sample
 
This sample is designed to illustrate compiler optimization features and programming concepts.

This program computes the integral (area under the curve) of a user-supplied function 
over an interval in a stepwise fashion. 
The interval is split into segments and at each segment position the area of a rectangle 
is computed with the height of sine's value at that point, and the width is the segment width. 
The areas of the rectangles are then summed.

The process is repeated with smaller and smaller width rectangles, 
more closely approximating the true value.

The source for this program also demonstrates recommended Fortran coding practices.

## Purpose

The Intel® Fortran Compiler can optimize applications for performance.  The primary compiler option is -O followed by a numeric optimization "level" from 0 requesting no optimization to 3, which requests all compiler optimizations for the application. The -O optimization levels are:

   * O0 - No optimizations
   * O1 - Enables optimizations for speed and disables some optimizations that increase code size and affect speed.
   * O2 - Enables optimizations for speed. This is the generally recommended optimization level. Vectorization is enabled at O2 and higher levels.
   * O3 - Performs O2 optimizations and enables more aggressive loop transformations such as Fusion, Block-Unroll-and-Jam, and collapsing IF statements.

Read the [Intel® Fortran Compiler Developer Guide and Reference](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/fortran-compiler-developer-guide-and-reference/top.html) for more information about these options.

Some of these compiler optimizations use features and options that can 
restrict program execution to specific architectures.

## Building the `Fortran Optimization` sample
  
Use one of the following compiler options:


### macOS* : -O0 -O1, -O2, -O3 

### STEP 1: Build and run with -O0
cd optimize_samples 

Edit 'Makefile' using your favorite editor

To set optimization level uncomment FC = ifort -O0 like this 
    
     FC = ifort -O0 
     #FC = ifort -O1 
     #FC = ifort -O2 
     #FC = ifort -O3  
   * Build the executable with 'make'     
     
     make 

   * Run the program
  
     make run

   * Note the final run time (example)
    CPU Time = 3.776983 seconds

   * Clean the files we built
   
    make clean


### STEP 2: Build and run with -O1
Edit 'Makefile' using your favorite editor

To set optimization level uncomment FC = ifort -O1 like this
    
     #FC = ifort -O0
     FC = ifort -O1
     #FC = ifort -O2
     #FC = ifort -O3
   * Build the executable with 'make'
  
    make

   * Run the program
  
    make run

   * Note the final run time (example)
    CPU Time = 1.444569 seconds

   * Clean the files we built
    
    make clean
    

### STEP 3: Build and run with -O2
Edit 'Makefile' using your favorite editor

To set optimization level uncomment FC = ifort -O2 like this
    
     #FC = ifort -O0
     #FC = ifort -O1
     FC = ifort -O2
     #FC = ifort -O3
   * Build the executable with 'make'
   
    make

   * Run the program
    
    make run

   * Note the final run time (example)
     CPU Time = 0.5143980 seconds

   * Clean the files we built
  
    make clean

### STEP 4: Build and run with -O3
Edit 'Makefile' using your favorite editor

To set optimization level uncomment FC = ifort -O3 like this

     #FC = ifort -O0
     #FC = ifort -O1
     #FC = ifort -O2
     FC = ifort -O3
   * Build the executable with 'make'
    
    make

   * Run the program
    
    make run

   * Note the final run time (example)
     CPU Time = 0.5133380 seconds

   * Clean the files we built
   
    make clean

## What did we learn?
There are big jumps going from O0 to O1, and from O1 to O2. 
But we see minimal performance gain going from O2 to O3.
This does vary by application but generally with Intel® Compilers 
O2 has the most optimizations.  Sometimes O3 can help, of course,
but generally, O2 is sufficient for most applications. 

### Further Exploration
The Intel® Fortran Compiler has many options for optimization. 
If you have a genuine Intel® Architecture processor, try these additional options

   edit 'Makefile' using your favorite editor. To set additional optimizations uncomment FC = ifort -O3 and add additional options shown:
   
     #FC = ifort -O0
     #FC = ifort -O1
     #FC = ifort -O2
     FC = ifort -O3 -xhost -align array64byte
   * Build the executable with the new options -xhost -align array64byte
  
    make

   * Run the program
   
    make run

   * Note the final run time (example)
     CPU Time = 0.2578490 seconds

   * Clean the program

    make clean
    
There are two additional compiler options here that are worth mentioning: Read the online 
[Developer Guide and Reference](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/fortran-compiler-developer-guide-and-reference/top.html)for more information about
these options.
 
 1. -xhost (sub option of -X option):  [X](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/fortran-compiler-oneapi-dev-guide-and-reference/top/compiler-reference/compiler-options/compiler-option-details/code-generation-options/x-qx.html "-x option)
 2. -align array64byte: [-align](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/fortran-compiler-oneapi-dev-guide-and-reference/top/compiler-reference/compiler-options/compiler-option-details/data-options/align.html)

### Clean up 
   * Clean the program
