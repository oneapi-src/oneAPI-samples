# How to Contribute

We welcome community contributions to the oneAPI-samples project. You can:

- Submit your changes directly as a [pull request](#pull-requests)
- Log a bug or feature request with an [issue](#issues)

## Pull requests

We accept contributions as pull requests on GitHub. To contribute your changes
directly to the repository, please do the following:

* Follow the [Git Steps for contribution](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/wiki/Git-Steps-for-Contribution).
* Make sure your PR has a clear purpose, and does one thing only, and nothing more. This will enable us review your PR more quickly.
* Make sure each commit in your PR is a small, atomic change representing one step in development.
* Squash intermediate steps within PR for bug fixes, style cleanups, reversions, etc., so they do not appear in merged PR history.
* Explain anything non-obvious from the code in comments, commit messages, or the PR description, as appropriate.

## Issues

GitHub Issues tracks sample development issues, bugs, and feature requests.
For usage, installation, or other requests for help, please use the [IntelÂ® oneAPI Forums](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-oneapi-forums) instead.

When reporting a bug, please provide the following information, where applicable:

* What are the steps to reproduce the bug?
* Can you reproduce the bug using the latest [master](https://github.com/samples-ci/oneAPI-samples) and the latest oneAPI toolkit related to the sample?
* What CPU/GPU, platform, operating system/distribution are you running? The more specific, the better.

## Sign your work

Please use the sign-off line at the end of the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):
