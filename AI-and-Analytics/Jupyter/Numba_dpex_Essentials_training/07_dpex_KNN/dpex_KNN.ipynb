    "# KNN Algorithm\n",
    "KNN is a supervised ML algorithm that based on similar patters where the items are placed closer to each other. Supervised machine learning involves situations where there is a known outcome from historical data. ​ The goal is to take a small subset of data to learn how to predict these outcomes so that the same method can be applied later to predict outcomes for as yet unseen data. For supervised learning, you need both “X”, the feature data, as well as “y” data, also known as a target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification routines are typically used to analyze features of a dataset. Think of these as columns of data in a spreadsheet, and to find patterns among the data in order to predict or classify a target variable, think of this as a single column (typically) that we might call the “y” value. In classification, the “y” value is usually a discrete variable – such as “tumor”, “no tumor”. Another example might be “cat” versus “dog” versus “bird”. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Regression problems, outcome is a continuous number​ For example, house prices, box office revenue, attendance to an event etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is a simple and powerful ML algorithm that places similar items together. We need model data with features that can be quantitated, labels that are known and method to measure similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In KNN the first thing we need is the correctly determined value of k. Second we need to know how to measure the distance of neighbors using for example L2 distance."
