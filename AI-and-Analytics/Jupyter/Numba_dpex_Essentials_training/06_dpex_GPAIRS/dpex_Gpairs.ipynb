    "\n",
    "In a parallel algorithm, there is a high degree of reuse, so instead of loading values from global memory each time we can load the values into local memory and perform the computation.  This will reduce the latency of accessing the data values.  The difference between this implementation and the ND-range implementation is the reading is done from global memory in the case of ND-range each time and in this implementation they dat is loaded into local memory and then computed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a work-group begins, the contents of its local memory are uninitialized, and local memory does not persist after a work-group finishes executing. Because of these properties, local memory may only be used for temporary storage while a work-group is executing.  For other devices though, such as many GPU devices, there are dedicated resources for local memory, and on these devices, communicating via local memory should perform better than communicating via global memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SYCL’s memory model, local memory is a contiguous region of memory allocated per work group and is visible to all the work items in that group. Local memory is device-only and cannot be accessed from the host. From the perspective offers the device, the local memory is exposed as a contiguous array of a specific types. The maximum available local memory is hardware-specific. The SYCL local memory concept is analogous to CUDA’s shared memory concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba-dpex provides a special function numba_dpex.local.array to allocate local memory for a kernel. To simplify kernel development and accelerate communication between work-items in a work-group, SYCL defines a special local memory space specifically for communication between work-items in a work-group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Address Space refers to memory objects that need to be allocated in local memory pool and are shared by all work-items of a work-group. Numba-dpex does not support passing arguments that are allocated in the local address space to @numba_dpex.kernel. Users are allowed to allocate static arrays in the local address space inside the @numba_dpex.kernel. In the example below numba_dpex.local.array(shape, dtype) is the API used to allocate a static array in the local address space:\n",
    "These are used to compute an intermediate result which does not use global memory for repeated access for computation. \n",
