    "This course covers commonly used AI algorithms implemented in Scikit-learn. It provides the conceptual framework for how and why these algorithms can be used to solve machine learning problems. It also applies acceleration via the Intel Extensions for Scikit-learn. The accelerations is accomplished with two lines of code and achieves acceleration of one to three orders of magnitude speed-ups over the stock scikit-learn implementations on Intel CPU's\n",
