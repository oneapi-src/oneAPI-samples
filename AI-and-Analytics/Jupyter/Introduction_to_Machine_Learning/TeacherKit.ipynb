    "This course covers commonly used AI algorithms implemented in Scikit-learn*. It provides the conceptual framework for how and why these algorithms can be used to solve machine learning problems. It also applies acceleration via the Intel Extensions for Scikit-learn. The acceleration is accomplished with two lines of code and provides one to three orders of magnitude speed-ups over the stock Scikit-learn implementations on Intel CPU's.\n",
