  "description": "The Jupyter Notebooks in these samples are intended to give professors and students an accessible but challenging introduction to machine learning. It enumerates and describes many commonly used Scikit-learn* algorithms, which are used daily to address machine learning challenges. It has a secondary benefit of demonstrating how to accelerate commonly used Scikit-learn algorithms for Intel CPUs using Intel Extensions for Scikit-learn* which is part of the Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) powered by oneAPI. This workshop is designed to be used on the Intel® DevCloud and includes details on submitting batch jobs on the DevCloud environment.",
