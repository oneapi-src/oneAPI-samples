## Purpose
The Jupyter Notebooks in this training are inended to give professors and students an accesible but challenging introduction to machine learning.  It enumerates and describes many commonly used Scikit-learn* allgorithms which are used  daily to address machine learning challenges.  It has a secondary benefit of demonstrating how to accelerate commonly used Scikit-learn algorithms for Intel CPUs using Intel Extensions for Scikit-learn* which is part of the Intel AI Analytics Toolkit powered by oneAPI.

This workshop is designed to be used on the DevCloud and includes details on submitting batch jobs on the DevCloud environment.

At the end of this course you will be able to:

- Explain cost functions, regularization, feature selection, and hyper-parameters
- Summarize complex statistical optimization algorithms
like gradient descent and its application to linear regression
- Apply IntelÂ® Extension for Scikit-learn* to leverage underlying compute capabilities of hardware using two lines of code
``` python
      from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
      patch_sklearn()
```
