    "Frameworks provide structure that Data Scientists use to build code. Frameworks are more than just libraries, because in addition to callable code, frameworks influence how code is written. \n",
    "\n",
    "A main virtue of using an optimized framework is that code runs faster. Code that runs faster is just generally more convenient but when we begin looking at applied data science and AI models, we can see more material benefits. Here you will see how optimization, particularly hyperparameter optimization can benefit more than just speed. \n",

    "These exercises will demonstrate how to apply **the Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn*,** a seamless way to speed up your Scikit-learn application. The acceleration is achieved through the use of the Intel® oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL). Patching is the term used to extend scikit-learn with Intel optimizations and makes it a well-suited machine learning framework for dealing with real-life problems. \n",
