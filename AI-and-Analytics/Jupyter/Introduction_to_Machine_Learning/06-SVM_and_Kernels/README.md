## Purpose
The Jupyter Notebooks in this training are inended to give professors and students an accesible but challenging introduction to machine learning.  It enumerates and describes many commonly used Scikit-learn* allgorithms which are used  daily to address machine learning challenges.  It has a secondary benefit of demonstrating how to accelerate commonly used Scikit-learn algorithms for Intel CPUs using Intel Extensions for Scikit-learn* which is part of the Intel AI Analytics Toolkit powered by oneAPI.

This workshop is designed to be used on the DevCloud and includes details on submitting batch jobs on the DevCloud environment.

At the end of this course you will be able to:

- Describe the the comnceptual framework and application of commonly used Scilkit-learn algorithms across a variety of problem domains including clustering, classifiation, regression, dimenionality reduction and more.
- Apply Scikit-learn* algorithms to solve specified problems described in each notebook. 
- Describe where to download and install AI Analytics Toolkit.
- Apply IntelÂ® Extension for Scikit-learn* to leverage underlying compute capabilities of hardware using two lines of code
``` python
      from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
      patch_sklearn()
```
