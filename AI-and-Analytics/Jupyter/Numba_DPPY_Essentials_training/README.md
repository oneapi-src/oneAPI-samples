# Numba Data parallel python training Jupyter notebooks

The purpose of this repo is to be the central aggregation, curation, and
distribution point for Juypter notebooks that are developed in support of
Numba Data parallel python training programs. These initial hands-on exercises introduce you to concepts of Data Parallel Python. In addition, it familiarizes you how to execute on multiple devices using Data Parallel Python (DPPY), utilize Numba and Numba-DPPY to write paralle code on GPU.

The Jupyter notebooks are tested and can be run on the Intel Devcloud. Below
are the steps to access these Jupyter notebooks on the Intel Devcloud:

1. Register with the Intel Devcloud at
   https://intelsoftwaresites.secure.force.com/devcloud/oneapi

2. SSH into the Intel Devcloud "terminal"

3. Type the following command to download the Numba Data parallel Python series of
   Jupyter notebooks into your devcloud account
   `/data/oneapi_workshop/get_jupyter_notebooks.sh`
   
### Running the Jupyter Notebooks locally on a Linux machine OR WSL:
1. Update your system:
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
2. After the update a reboot will be required, enter:
   sudo reboot
3. Download and Install Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit and Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit.
   https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html
4. You can close the terminal and launch a new one and enter:
   source .bashrc
   which will result in the base conda environment being activated.
5. Enter:
   conda env list
   Note: if Conda not recognized enter
   source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh   
6. Launch a terminal and enter:
    conda create –-clone base –-name <pick something> for example:
    conda create --clone base --name jupyter
7. Conda env list:
    You should see two environments now.  The * denotes the active environment.  
    Activate the new environment:
    Conda activate jupyter    
8. Install Jupyterlab:
   conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab    
9. Clone the Intel oneAPI Samples Repository, Git will likely not be installed so to install it enter:
    sudo apt install git
    git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git    
10. Launch JupyterLab by typing in "jupyter lab" in the terminal. 
11. Make a note of the address printed on the terminal and paste it in the browser window.
12. JupyterLab opens up and navigate to ~/oneAPI-samples/AI-and-Analytics/Jupyter/Numba_DPPY_Essentials_training and double click on "Welcome.ipynb" to get started.
