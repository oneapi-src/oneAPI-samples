    "## Parallelism in Python Using Numba\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has become a pervasive and useful tool in advancing scientific research and computation. Python has a very rich ecosystem of open-source packages for mathematics, science, and engineering, anchored on the performant numerical computation on arrays and matrices, data analysis and visualization capabilities, and an interactive development environment that enables rapid and collaborative iteration of ideas. Python is used to discover new objects in space, calculate thermodynamics, conduct genomic analysis of cancer, estimate the likelihood of earthquakes, simulate musculoskeletal systems, visualize asteroid chemistries, and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intel’s accelerated Python packages enable scientists to take advantage of the productivity of Python, while taking advantage of the ever-increasing performance of modern hardware. Intel optimized implementations of NumPy and SciPy leverage the Intel Math Kernel Library to achieve highly efficient multithreading, vectorization, and memory management.\n",
    "Python as a programming language has enjoyed nearly a decade of use in both industry and academia. This high-productivity language has been one of the most popular abstractions to scientific computing and machine learning, yet the base Python language remains single-threaded. Just how is productivity in these fields being maintained with a single-threaded language?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language’s design, by Guido van Rossum, was meant to trade off type flexibility and predictable, thread-safe behavior against the complexity of having to manage static types and threading primitives. This, in turn, meant having to enforce a global interpreter lock (GIL) to limit execution to a single thread at a time to preserve this design mentality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last decade, many concurrency implementations have been made for Python―but few in the region of parallelism. Does this mean the language isn’t performant? Let’s explore further.\n",
    "The base language’s fundamental constructs for loops and other asynchronous or concurrent calls all abide by the single-threaded GIL, so even list comprehensions such as [x*x for x in range(0,10)] will always be single-threaded. The threading library’s existence in the base language is also a bit misleading, since it provides the behavior of a threading implementation but still operates under the GIL. Many of the features of Python’s concurrent futures to almost parallel tasks also operate under the GIL. Why does such an expressive productivity language restrict the language to these rules?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is the level of abstraction the language design adopted. It ships with many tools to wrap C code, from ctypes to cffi. It prefers multiprocessing over multithreading in the base language, as evidenced by the multiprocessing package in the native Python library. These two design ideas are evident in some of the popular packages, like NumPy and SciPy, which use C code under the Python API to dispatch to a mathematical runtime library such as Intel Math Kernel Library (Intel MKL) or OpenBLAS. The community has adopted the paradigm to dispatch to higher-speed C-based libraries, and has become the preferred method to implement parallelism in Python.\n",
    "In the combination of these accepted methods and language limitations are options to escape them and apply parallelism in Python through unique parallelism frameworks:\n",
    "* Numba allows for JIT-based compilation of Python code, which can also run LLVM-based Python-compatible code.\n",
    "* Cython gives Python-like syntax with compiled modules that can target hardware vectorization as it compiles to a C module.\n",
    "* numexpr allows for symbolic evaluation to utilize compilers and advanced vectorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods escape Python’s GIL in different ways while preserving the original intent of the language, and all three implement different models of parallelism.\n",
    "Let’s take the general example of one of the most common language constructs on which we’d want to apply parallelism—the for loop. Looking at the following loop, we can see that it provides a basic service, a vector addition:"

Cleanliness of datatypes and the use of vectorizable data structures allow Numba to parallelize code with the insertion of a simple decorator.

    "By default, if a section of code cannot be offloaded to the GPU, it is automatically executed on the CPU and a warning is printed. This behavior is only applicable to JIT functions, auto-offloading of NumPy calls, array expressions and prange loops. To disable this functionality and force code running on GPU, set the environment variable NUMBA_DPPY_FALLBACK_OPTION to false (for example, export NUMBA_DPPY_FALLBACK_OPTION=0). In this case the code is not automatically offloaded to the CPU and errors occur if any.\n",

In the \"Auto-offloading\" section there is the information on which device (device name) this kernel was offloaded.\n",
