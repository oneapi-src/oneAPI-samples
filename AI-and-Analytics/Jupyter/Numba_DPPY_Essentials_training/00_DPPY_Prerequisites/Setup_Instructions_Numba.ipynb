    "__JupyterLab__ is a sequence of boxes referred to as \"cells\". Each cell will contain text, like this one, or C++ or Python code that may be executed as part of this tutorial. As you proceed, please note the following:\n",

    "* The active cell is indicated by the blue bar on the left. Click on a cell to select it.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Use the __\"run\"__ ▶ button at the top or __Shift+Enter__ to execute a selected cell, starting with this one.\n",

Saved Jupyter Notebooks will save sequence numbers which may make a cell appear to have been executed when it has not been executed for the new session. Because state is not saved, re-opening or __restarting a Jupyter Notebook__ will required re-executing all the executable steps, starting in order from the beginning.\n",

    "* Cells containing Markdown can be executed and will render. However, there is no indication of execution, and it is not necessary to explicitly execute Markdown cells.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Cells containing executable code will have \"a [ ]:\" to the left of the cell:\n",
    "  * __[ ]__ blank indicates that the cell has not yet been executed.\n",
    "  * __[\\*]__ indicates that the cell is currently executing.\n",
    "  * Once a cell is done executing, a number will appear in the small brackets with each cell execution to indicate where in the sequence the cell has been executed. Any output (e.g. print()'s) from the code will appear below the cell."
