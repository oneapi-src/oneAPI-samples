    "Dpctl provides a lightweight Python wrapper over a subset of DPC++/SYCL’s API. The goal of dpctl is not (yet) to provide an abstraction for every SYCL function. Dpctl is intended to provide a common runtime to manage specific SYCL resources, such as devices and USM memory, for SYCL-based Python packages and extension modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main features presently provided by dpctl are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python wrapper classes for the main SYCL runtime classes mentioned in Section 4.6 of SYCL provisional 2020 spec (https://bit.ly/3asQx07): `platform`, `device`, `context`, `device_selector`, and `queue`.\n",
    "1. A USM memory manager to create Python objects that use SYCL USM for data allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Dpctl is available as part of the oneAPI Intel Distribution of Python (IDP). Once oneAPI is installed, dpctl is ready to be used by setting up the IDP that is available inside oneAPI. "
