# `Intel Extension for PyTorch Getting Started` Sample

Intel Extension for PyTorch is a Python package to extend the official PyTorch. It is designed to make the Out-of-Box user experience of PyTorch CPU better while achieving good performance. The extension also will be the PR(Pull-Request) buffer for the Intel PyTorch framework dev team. The PR buffer will contain functions and optimization (for example, take advantage of Intel's new hardware features).
