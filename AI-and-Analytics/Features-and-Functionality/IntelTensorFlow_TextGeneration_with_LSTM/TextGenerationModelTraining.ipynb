    "## LSTM Operator Override Intel Extension for TensorFlow \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides leveraging AI and oneAPI Kit for GPU execution, Intel extension for TensorFlow (Itex) offers operator overrides for some of the Keras layers. In this sample LSTM for text generation model will be used. A LSTM (Long Short-term Memory first proposed in Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) Neural Network is just another kind of Artificial Neural Network, containing LSTM cells as neurons in some of its layers. Every LSTM layer will contain many LSTM cells. Every LSTM cell looks at its own input column, plus the previous column's cell output. This is how an LSTM cell logic works on determining what qualifies to extract from the previous cell:\n",
    " - Forget gate - determines influence from the previous cell (and its timestamp) on the current one. It uses the 'sigmoid' layer (the result is between 0.0 and 1.0) to decide whether should it be forgotten or remembered\n",
    " - Input gate - the cell tries to learn from the input to this cell. It does that with a dot product of sigmoid (from Forget Gate) and tanh unit. \n",
    " - Output gate - another dot product of the tanh and sigmoid unit. Updated information is passed from the current to the next timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing a cell's state/information at timestamps is related to long-term memory and hidden state - to short-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using LSTM layer from Keras, Itex LSTM layer is better optimized for execution on Intel platform. LSTM layer, provided by Itex is semantically the same as [tf.keras.layers.LSTM](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM). Based on available runtime hardware and constraints, this layer will choose different implementations (ITEX-based or fallback-TensorFlow) to maximize the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the model and adding Embedding layer, optimized LSTM layer from Itex can be added. Note, however, that this is sample for mentioned input text. Parameters are open to experiment, depending on the input text. Model accuracy with existing parameters is reaching 80%."
