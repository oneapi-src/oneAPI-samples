    "Let's start with the question **What is a genetic algorithm?**. It is an algorithm, search heuristic inspired by the process of natural selection. It is usually applied to various optimization problems, NP-hard problems for which finding a solution by standard methods is very time and resource consuming. This algorithm makes it possible to obtain a satisfying high quality result based on biology-inspired operations, such as:\n",
    " \n",
    "* selection - is the process of selecting parents who mate and recombine to create offspring for the next generation. Parent selection is very crucial to the convergence rate of the GA as good parents drive individuals to better and fitter solutions.\n",
    "* crossover - is a process similar to biological crossover. In this, more than one parent is selected and one or more offspring are produced using the genetic material of the parents.\n",
    "* mutation - small random tweak in the chromosome, to get a new solution. It is used to maintain and introduce diversity in the genetic population and is usually applied with a low probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "To apply the genetic algorithm to a specific problem, it is important to define the representation of the chromosome, as well as how the three operations should look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will show, first, the general implementation of the genetic algorithm, and then the adaptation of this function to the Traveling Salesman Problem."
