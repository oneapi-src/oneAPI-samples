# `Enable Auto-Mixed Precision for Transfer Learning with TensorFlow*` Sample

The `Enable Auto-Mixed Precision for Transfer Learning with TensorFlow*` sample guides you through the process of enabling auto-mixed precision to use low-precision datatypes, like bfloat16, for transfer learning with TensorFlow* (TF).

The sample demonstrates the end-to-end pipeline tasks typically performed in a deep learning use-case: training (and retraining), inference optimization, and serving the model with TensorFlow Serving.

## Purpose

Through the implementation of end-to-end deep learning example, this sample demonstrates important concepts:
- The benefits of using auto-mixed precision to accelerate tasks like transfer learning, with minimal changes to existing scripts.
- The importance of inference optimization on performance.
- The ease of using Intel® optimizations in TensorFlow, which are enabled by default in 2.9.0 and newer.

#### Troubleshooting

If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the [Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/diagnostic-utility-user-guide/top.html) for more information on using the utility.


## Example Output

You will see diagrams comparing performance and analysis. This includes performance comparison for training speedup obtained by enabling auto-mixed precision and inference speedup obtained by optimizing the saved model for inference.

For performance analysis, you will see histograms showing different Tensorflow* operations in the analyzed pre-trained model pb file.
