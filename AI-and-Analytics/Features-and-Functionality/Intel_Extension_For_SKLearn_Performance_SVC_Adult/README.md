# `Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn: SVC for Adult dataset` Sample
This sample code uses the [Adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) to show how to train and predict with a SVC algorithm using Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn. It demonstrates how to use software products that can be found in the [Intel® oneAPI Data Analytics Library](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onedal.html), [Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn](https://intel.github.io/scikit-learn-intelex/), and [Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html).

## Purpose

Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn is a seamless way to speed up your Scikit-learn application. The acceleration is achieved through the use of the Intel® oneAPI Data Analytics Library ([oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL)](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDAL)). Patching scikit-learn makes it a well-suited machine learning framework for dealing with real-life problems.

In this sample, you will run a SVC algorithm with Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn and compare its performance against the original stock version of scikit-learn. You will see that patching scikit-learn results in a significant increase in performance over the original scikit-learn while also maintaining the same precision.

## Key Implementation Details
The sample code is written in Python and it targets CPU architecture. The example assumes you have Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn installed.

### Using Visual Studio Code*  (VS Code)

You can use VS Code extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.

To learn more about the extensions and how to configure the oneAPI environment, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).
