    "# Quantizing LLMs for INT4/8 Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "As models continue to grow in size, the demand for improved quantization techniques becomes increasingly essential. But what exactly is quantization? Quantization involves representing model parameters in lower precision. For instance, instead of the commonly used float32, utilizing float16 to represent model weights can halve the storage requirements. Moreover, it enhances performance by reducing computational load when operating at lower precision. However, one downside of quantization is a slight drop in model accuracy. This occurs because parameters have less representation power at lower precision. Essentially, with quantization, we trade accuracy for improved performance (both in terms of computation and storage) during inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to quantization, there are various methods available, but this sample focuses solely on Weight Only Quantization techniques (WOQ). Typically, both model weights and activations (output values generated by each neuron in a layer) are quantized. However, WOQ exclusively quantizes the model weights, leaving activations unchanged. In practice, WOQ yields performance benefits without significantly impacting accuracy."

    "HuggingFace's transformers library simplifies the quantization process by providing straightforward options. Users can simply set the `load_in_4bit` or `load_in_8bit` argument to `True` to enable quantization. However, there's a limitation: this feature is exclusive to CUDA GPUs. When these arguments are activated, a `BitsandBytes` configuration is automatically generated, which unfortunately only works on CUDA GPU devices. This poses a challenge for users operating on CPUs or non-CUDA devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this limitation, the Intel team developed Intel Extension for Transformers (ITREX), which enhances quantization support and offers additional optimizations for Intel CPU/GPU architectures. To utilize ITREX, users can import `AutoModelForCasualLM` from the ITREX library instead of the transformers library. This enables users to leverage quantization and other optimizations seamlessly, regardless of their hardware configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've extended the `from_pretrained` method to accommodate the `quantization_config`, which now accepts various configurations such as `RtnConfig`, `AwqConfig`, `TeqConfig`, `GPTQConfig`, and `AutoroundConfig` for implementing quantization on the CPU, along side CUDA GPUs. When you set the `load_in_4bit` or `load_in_8bit` argument to `True`, the behavior depends on your device configuration. If your device is set to CUDA, then `BitsAndBytesConfig` will be utilized. However, if your device is set to CPU, `RtnConfig`, which is specially optimized for Intel CPUs and GPUs, will be employed. This basically provides same interface for using Intel CPUs, Intel GPUs and CUDA devices, ensuring seamless quantization across different hardware configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one caveat to note: not all model architectures are currently supported. Currently, only the most commonly used LLMs, which cover the majority of use cases, are supported. However, our team is actively working to optimize more models. For a comprehensive list of supported models, please refer to [this link](https://github.com/intel/neural-speed/blob/v0.3/docs/supported_models.md).\n",

It quantizes weight block by block and fine-tunes the remaining unquantized ones to mitigate quantization errors. Occasionally, Non-positive semidefinite matrices may occur, necessitating adjustments to hyperparameters.\n",

Additionally, it offers hypeparameters tuning compatibility to further enhance performance.
