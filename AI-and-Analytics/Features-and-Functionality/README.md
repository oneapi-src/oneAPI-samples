# Features and Functionalities for Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit

The Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit gives data scientists, AI developers, and researchers familiar Python* tools and frameworks to accelerate end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines on Intel® architectures. The components are built using oneAPI libraries for low-level compute optimizations. This toolkit maximizes performance from preprocessing through machine learning, and provides interoperability for efficient model development.

You can find more information at [ AI Analytics Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html).

Users could understand more details of features in oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkits with those features and functionality samples.
