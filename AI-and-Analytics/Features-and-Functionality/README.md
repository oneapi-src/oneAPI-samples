# Features and Functionalities for Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit)

The Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) gives data scientists, AI developers, and researchers familiar Python* tools and frameworks to accelerate end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines on Intel® architectures. The components are built using oneAPI libraries for low-level compute optimizations. This toolkit maximizes performance from preprocessing through machine learning, and provides interoperability for efficient model development.
