# `Intel Python XGBoost Getting Started` Sample
XGBoost* is a widely used gradient boosting library in the classical ML area. Designed for flexibility, performance, and portability, XGBoost* includes optimized distributed gradient boosting frameworks and implements Machine Learning algorithms underneath. Starting with 0.9 version of XGBoost, Intel has been upstreaming optimizations to the through the `hist` histogram tree-building method. Starting with 1.3.3 version of XGBoost and beyond, Intel has also begun upstreaming inference optimziations to XGBoost as well.

| Software                          | XGBoost, Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit
| What you will learn               | basic XGBoost programming model for Intel CPU
| Time to complete                  | 5 minutes

## Purpose
In this code sample, you will learn how to use Intel optimizations for XGBoost published as part of Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit. The sample also illustrates how to set up and train an XGBoost* model on datasets for prediction.
It also demonstrates how to use software products that can be found in the [Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html).

## Key Implementation Details
This Getting Started sample code is implemented for CPU using the Python language. The example assumes you have XGboost installed inside a conda environment, similar to what is delivered with the installation of the Intel® Distribution for Python* as part of the [Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi/ai-kit).

## Building XGBoost for CPU

XGBoost* is ready for use once you finish the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit installation and have run the post installation script.

You can refer to the oneAPI [main page](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi) for toolkit installation and the Toolkit [Getting Started Guide for Linux](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-linux-get-started-with-the-intel-ai-analytics-toolkit) for post-installation steps and scripts.


> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script located in
> the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux Sudo: . /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Linux User: . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
>
> Windows: C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat
>
>For more information on environment variables, see Use the setvars Script for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

### Activate conda environment With Root Access

However, if you activated another environment, you can return with the following command:

#### On a Linux* System
```
source activate base
```

### Activate conda environment Without Root Access (Optional)

By default, the Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit is installed in the inteloneapi folder, which requires root privileges to manage it. If you would like to bypass using root access to manage your conda environment, then you can clone your desired conda environment using the following command:

#### On a Linux* System
```
conda create --name user_base --clone base
```

Then activate your conda environment with the following command:

```
source activate user_base
```

### Install Jupyter Notebook

Launch Jupyter Notebook in the directory housing the code example

```
conda install jupyter nb_conda_kernels
```

#### View in Jupyter Notebook

_Note: This distributed execution cannot be launched from the jupyter notebook version, but you can still view inside the notebook to follow the included write-up and description._

Launch Jupyter Notebook in the directory housing the code example

```
jupyter notebook
```
## Running the Sample

### Running the Sample as a Jupyter Notebook

Open .pynb file and run cells in Jupyter Notebook using the "Run" button (see the image using "Modin Getting Started" sample)

![Click the Run Button in the Jupyter Notebook](Jupyter_Run.jpg "Run Button on Jupyter Notebook")

##### Expected Printed Output for Cells (with similar numbers):
```
RMSE: 11.113036205909719
[CODE_SAMPLE_COMPLETED_SUCCESFULLY]
```


### Running the Sample as a Python File

Open notebook in Jupyter and download as python file (see the image using "daal4py Hello World"  sample)

![Download as python file in the Jupyter Notebook](Jupyter_Save_Py.jpg "Download as python file in the Jupyter Notebook")

Run the Program

`python IntelPython_XGBoost_GettingStarted.py`

The output files of the script will be saved in the included models and result directories.

##### Expected Printed Output (with similar numbers):
```
RMSE: 11.113036205909719
[CODE_SAMPLE_COMPLETED_SUCCESFULLY]
```

### Build and run additional samples
Several sample programs are available for you to try, many of which can be compiled and run in a similar fashion. Experiment with running the various samples on different kinds of compute nodes or adjust their source code to experiment with different workloads.

### Troubleshooting
If an error occurs, troubleshoot the problem using the Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits.

### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment, create launch configurations,
and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the Generate Launch Configurations extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.
