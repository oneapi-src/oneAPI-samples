# `PyTorch HelloWorld` Sample
PyTorch* is a very populiar framework for deep learning. Intel and Facebook* collaborate to boost PyTorch* CPU Performance for years. The official PyTorch has been optimized using oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) primitives by default. This sample demostrates how to train a PyTorch model and shows how Intel-optimized PyTorch* enables Intel® DNNL calls by default. 

| Optimized for                       | Description
|:---                               |:---

| Hardware                          | Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processor family
| Software                          | Intel&reg; oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit
| What you will learn               | How to getting started with Intel Optimization for PyTorch

## Purpose
This sample code shows how to get started with Intel Optimization for PyTorch. It implements an example neural network with one convolution layer, one normalization layer and one ReLU layer. Developers can quickly build and train a PyTorch* neural network using simple python code. In addition, by controlling the build-in environment variable, the sample attempts to show explicitly how Intel® DNNL Primitives are called as well as their performance during PyTorch* model training and inference.

Intel-optimized PyTorch* is available as part of Intel® AI Analytics Toolkit. For more information on the optimizations as well as performance data, see this blog post http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-and-facebook-collaborate-to-boost-pytorch-cpu-performance.

## Key implementation details
This Hello World sample code is implemented for CPU using the Python language. 

*Please* **export the environment variable `DNNL_VERBOSE=1`** *to display the deep learning primitives trace during execution.*

### Notes
 - The test dataset is inherited from `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.
 - The model is inherited from `torch.nn.Module`.
 - For the inference portion, `to_mkldnn()` function in `torch.utils.mkldnn` can accelerate performance by eliminating data reorders between operations which are supported by Intel(R) DNNL.

## How to Build and Run 
### Running Samples In DevCloud (Optional)
If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, please follow the below steps to build the python environment. Also remember that you must specify the compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) as well whether to run in batch or interactive mode. For more information see the Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide (https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/) 

1. Pre-requirement

    PyTorch is ready for use once you finish the Intel AI Analytics Toolkit installation, and have run post installation script. These steps apply to DevCloud as well.

    You can refer to the oneAPI [main page](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi) for toolkit installation, and the Toolkit [Getting Started Guide for Linux](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-linux-get-started-with-the-intel-ai-analytics-toolkit) for post-installation steps and scripts.

2. Activate conda environment With Root Access

    Please follow the Getting Started Guide steps (above) to set up your oneAPI environment with the setvars.sh script. Then navigate in linux shell to your oneapi installation path, typically `~/intel/inteloneapi`. Activate the conda environment with the following command:

    ```
    conda activate pytorch
    ```

3. Activate conda environment Without Root Access (Optional)

    By default, the Intel AI Analytics toolkit is installed in the inteloneapi folder, which requires root privileges to manage it. If you would like to bypass using root access to manage your conda environment, then you can clone your desired conda environment using the following command:

    ```
    conda create --name user_pytorch --clone pytorch
    ```

    Then activate your conda environment with the following command:

    ```
    conda activate user_pytorch
    ```

4. Run the Python script
    To run the program on Linux*, Windows* and MacOS*, simply type the following command in the terminal with Python installed:

    ```
    python PyTorch_Hello_World.py
    ```

    You will see the DNNL verbose trace after exporting the `DNNL_VERBOSE`:

    ```
    export DNNL_VERBOSE=1
    ```

    Please find more information about the mkldnn log [here](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneDNN/dev_guide_verbose.html).

## Example of Output
With successful execution, it will print out `[CODE_SAMPLE_COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY]` in the terminal.
