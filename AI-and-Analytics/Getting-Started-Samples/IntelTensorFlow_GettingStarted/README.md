## Purpose

TensorFlow* is a widely-used machine learning framework in the deep learning arena, demanding efficient computational resource utilization. To take full advantage of Intel® architecture and to extract maximum performance, the TensorFlow* framework has been optimized using Intel® oneDNN primitives. This sample demonstrates how to train an example neural network and shows how Intel-optimized TensorFlow* enables Intel® oneDNN calls by default. Intel-optimized TensorFlow* is available as part of the Intel® AI Tools.

This sample code shows how to get started with TensorFlow*. It implements an example neural network with one convolution layer and one ReLU layer. You can build and train a TensorFlow* neural network using a simple Python code. Also, by controlling the build-in environment variable, this sample attempts to demonstrate explicitly how Intel® oneDNN Primitives are called and shows their performance during the neural network training.

> **Note**: AI and Analytics samples are validated on AI Tools Offline Installer. For the full list of validated platforms refer to [Platform Validation](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#platform-validation).

## Key Implementation Details

The sample includes one python file: TensorFlow_HelloWorld.py. it implements a simple neural network's training and inference 
 - The training data is generated by `np.random`.
 - The neural network with one convolution layer and one ReLU layer is created by `tf.nn.conv2d` and `tf.nn.relu`.
 - The TF session is initialized by `tf.global_variables_initializer`.
 - The train is implemented via the below for-loop:
    ```python
    for epoch in range(0, EPOCHNUM):
        for step in range(0, BS_TRAIN):
            x_batch = x_data[step*N:(step+1)*N, :, :, :]
            y_batch = y_data[step*N:(step+1)*N, :, :, :]
            s.run(train, feed_dict={x: x_batch, y: y_batch})
    ```
In order to show the harware information, you must export the environment variable `ONEDNN_VERBOSE=1` to display the deep learning primitives trace during execution.
>**Note**: For convenience, code line os.environ["ONEDNN_VERBOSE"] = "1" has been added in the body of the script as an alternative method to setting this variable.

Runtime settings for `ONEDNN_VERBOSE`, `KMP_AFFINITY`, and `Inter/Intra-op` Threads are set within the script. You can read more about these settings in this dedicated document: *[Maximize TensorFlow* Performance on CPU: Considerations and Recommendations for Inference Workloads](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/maximize-tensorflow-performance-on-cpu-considerations-and-recommendations-for-inference)*.

### Run the Sample on Intel® GPUs
The sample code is CPU based, but you can run it using Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* with Intel® Data Center GPU Flex Series. If you are using the Intel GPU, refer to *[Intel GPU Software Installation Guide](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-tensorflow/latest/docs/install/install_for_gpu.html)*. The sample should be able to run on GPU **without any code changes**. 

For details, refer to the *[Quick Example on Intel CPU and GPU](https://intel.github.io/intel-extension-for-tensorflow/latest/examples/quick_example.html)* topic of the *Intel® Extension for TensorFlow** documentation. 

## Environment Setup

You will need to download and install the following toolkits, tools, and components to use the sample.

**1. Get Intel® AI Tools**

Required AI Tools: <Tensorflow* ><!-- List specific AI Tools that needs to be installed before running this sample --> 
<br>If you have not already, select and install these Tools via [AI Tools Selector](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/ai-tools-selector.html). AI and Analytics samples are validated on AI Tools Offline Installer. It is recommended to select Offline Installer option in AI Tools Selector.<br>
or simple pip install in your current ready python environment 
```
pip install tensorflow==2.14
```
please see the[supported versions](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/ai-tools-selector.html).

## Run the Sample

>**Note**: Before running the sample, make sure Environment Setup is completed.
Go to the section which corresponds to the installation method chosen in [AI Tools Selector](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/ai-tools-selector.html) to see relevant instructions:
* [AI Tools Offline Installer (Validated)](#ai-tools-offline-installer-validated)
* [Conda/PIP](#condapip) 
* [Docker](#docker)

### AI Tools Offline Installer (Validated)  
1. If you have not already done so, activate the AI Tools bundle base environment. If you used the default location to install AI Tools, open a terminal and type the following
```
source $HOME/intel/oneapi/intelpython/bin/activate
```
If you used a separate location, open a terminal and type the following
```
source <custom_path>/bin/activate
```
2. Activate the Conda environment:
```
conda activate tensorflow  
``` 
3. Clone the GitHub repository:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git
cd oneAPI-samples/AI-and-Analytics/Getting-Started-Samples/IntelTensorFlow_GettingStarted
```
### Run the Script

Run the Python script.
```
python TensorFlow_HelloWorld.py
```
## Example Output

1. With the initial run, you should see results similar to the following:

   ```
   0 0.4147554
   1 0.3561021
   2 0.33979267
   3 0.33283564
   4 0.32920069
   [CODE_SAMPLE_COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY]
   ```

2. Export `ONEDNN_VERBOSE` as 1 in the command line. The oneDNN run-time verbose trace should look similar to the following:
   ```
   export ONEDNN_VERBOSE=1
   Windows: set ONEDNN_VERBOSE=1
   ```
   >**Note**: The historical environment variables include `DNNL_VERBOSE` and `MKLDNN_VERBOSE`.

3. Run the sample again. You should see verbose results similar to the following:
   ```
