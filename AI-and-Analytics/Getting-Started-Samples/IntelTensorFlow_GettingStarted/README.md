# `TensorFlow HelloWorld` Sample
TensorFlow* is a widely-used machine learning framework in the deep learning arena, demanding efficient computational resource utilization. To take full advantage of Intel@reg; architecture and to extract maximum performance, the TensorFlow framework has been optimized using Intel@reg; Deep Neural Networks (&reg; DNNL) primitives. This sample demonstrates how to train an example neural network and shows how Intel-optimized TensorFlow enables Intel@reg; DNNL calls by default.

## Purpose
This sample code shows how to get started with Intel Optimization for TensorFlow*. It implements an example neural network with one convolution layer and one ReLU layer. Developers can quickly build and train a Tensorflow neural network using a simple python code. Also, by controlling the build-in environment variable, the sample attempts to explicitly show how Intel@reg; DNNL Primitives are called and their performance during the neural network training. 

Intel-optimized Tensorflow is available as part of the Intel@reg; AI Analytics Toolkit. For more information on the optimizations and performance data, see this blog post [TensorFlow* Optimizations on Modern Intel@reg; Architecture](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/tensorflow-optimizations-on-modern-intel-architecture.html).

## Key implementation details
*Please* **export the environment variable `MKLDNN_VERBOSE=1`** *to display the deep learning primitives trace during execution.*

 - The training data is generated by `np.random`. 
 - The neural network with one convolution layer and one ReLU layer is created by `tf.nn.conv2d` and `tf.nn.relu`.
 - The TF session is inistialized by `tf.global_variables_initializer`.
 - The train is implemented via the below for-loop: 
    ```python
    for epoch in range(0, EPOCHNUM):
        for step in range(0, BS_TRAIN):
            x_batch = x_data[step*N:(step+1)*N, :, :, :]
            y_batch = y_data[step*N:(step+1)*N, :, :, :]
            s.run(train, feed_dict={x: x_batch, y: y_batch})
    ```
    
##### Note: For convenience, code line os.environ["MKLDNN_VERBOSE"] = "1" has been added in the body of the script as an alternative method to setting this variable.

Runtime settings for `MKLDNN_VERBOSE`, `KMP_AFFINITY`, and `Inter/Intra-op` Threads are set within the script. You can read more about these settings in this dedicated document: [Maximize TensorFlow Performance on CPU: Considerations and Recommendations for Inference Workloads](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/maximize-tensorflow-performance-on-cpu-considerations-and-recommendations-for-inference)

## Build and Run the Sample

<!---Include the next paragraph ONLY if the sample runs in batch mode-->
### Run in Batch Mode
This sample runs in batch mode, so you must have a script for batch processing. Once you have a script set up, refer to the [Tensorflow Hello World](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/blob/master/AI-and-Analytics/Getting-Started-Samples/IntelTensorFlow_GettingStarted/README.md) instructions to run the sample.

<!---Include the next paragraph ONLY if the sample DOES NOT RUN in batch mode-->
### Run in Interactive Mode
This sample runs in interactive mode. Follow the directions in the README.md for the sample you want to run. If the sample can be run in interactive mode, the sample will have directions on how to run the sample in a Jupyter Notebook. An example can be found in the [Intel&reg; Modin Getting Started](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/AI-and-Analytics/Getting-Started-Samples/IntelModin_GettingStarted) sample.

### Request a Compute Node
In order to run on the DevCloud, you need to request a compute node using node properties such as: `gpu`, `xeon`, `fpga_compile`, `fpga_runtime` and others. For more information about the node properties, execute the `pbsnodes` command.
 This node information must be provided when submitting a job to run your sample in batch mode using the qsub command. When you see the qsub command in the Run section of the [Hello World instructions](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/aiAnalyticsToolkitSamples/), change the command to fit the node you are using. Nodes which are in bold indicate they are compatible with this sample:

<!---Mark each compatible Node in BOLD-->
| Node              | Command                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| GPU               | qsub -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2 -d . hello-world.sh           |
| CPU               | qsub -l nodes=1:xeon:ppn=2 -d . hello-world.sh          |
| FPGA Compile Time | qsub -l nodes=1:fpga\_compile:ppn=2 -d . hello-world.sh |
| FPGA Runtime      | qsub -l nodes=1:fpga\_runtime:ppn=2 -d . hello-world.sh |



### Pre-requirement

TensorFlow is ready for use once you finish the Intel AI Analytics Toolkit installation and have run the post installation script.

You can refer to the oneAPI [main page](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi) for toolkit installation and the Toolkit [Getting Started Guide for Linux](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-linux-get-started-with-the-intel-ai-analytics-toolkit) for post-installation steps and scripts.

### On a Linux* System
#### Activate conda environment With Root Access

Please follow the Getting Started Guide steps (above) to set up your oneAPI environment with the setvars.sh script. Then, navigate the Linux shell to your oneapi installation path, typically `~/intel/oneapi`. Activate the conda environment with the following command:

```
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
source activate tensorflow
```

please replace ~/intel/oneapi for your oneapi installation path.

#### Activate conda environment Without Root Access (Optional)

By default, the Intel AI Analytics toolkit is installed in the inteloneapi folder, which requires root privileges to manage it. If you would like to bypass using root access to manage your conda environment, then you can clone your desired conda environment using the following command:

```
conda create --name user_tensorflow --clone tensorflow
```

Then activate your conda environment with the following command:

```
source activate user_tensorflow
```

## Running the Sample

To run the program on Linux* or the environment of Intel DevCloud, type the following command in the terminal with Python installed:
```
    python TensorFlow_HelloWorld.py
```
### Example of Output
With successful execution, it will print out the following results:

```
    0 0.4147554
    1 0.3561021
    2 0.33979267
    3 0.33283564
    4 0.32920069
    [CODE_SAMPLE_COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY] 
```

If you export the DNNL_VERBOSE as 1 in the command line, the mkldnn run-time verbose trace should look similar to what is shown below:
```
export DNNL_VERBOSE=1
```

```
