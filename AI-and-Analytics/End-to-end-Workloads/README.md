# End-to-end samples for Intel速 oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit)

The Intel速 oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) gives data scientists, AI developers, and researchers familiar Python* tools and frameworks to accelerate end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines on Intel速 architectures. The components are built using oneAPI libraries for low-level compute optimizations. This toolkit maximizes performance from preprocessing through machine learning, and provides interoperability for efficient model development.

You can find more information at [ AI Kit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html).

Users could learn how to make use of AI Kit for their end-to-end workloads.

# End-to-end Samples

| Components      | Folder                                             | Description
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -
| Modin, oneDAL, IDP | [Census](Census)               | Use Intel速 Distribution of Modin to ingest and process U.S. census data from 1970 to 2010 in order to build a ridge regression based model to find the relation between education and the total income earned in the US.
| OpenVino | [LidarObjectDetection-PointPillars](LidarObjectDetection-PointPillars) | Performs 3D object detection and classification using data (point cloud) from a LIDAR sensor as input.

# Using Samples in Intel oneAPI DevCloud

You can use AI Kit samples in
the [Intel oneAPI DevCloud](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/) environment in the following ways:
* Log in to a DevCloud system via SSH and
  * use `git clone` to get a full copy of samples repository, or
  * use the `oneapi-cli` tool to download specific sample.
* Launch a JupyterLab server and run Jupyter Notebooks from your web browser.
