# End-to-End Samples for the Intel AI Tools

The Intel AI Tools give data scientists, AI
developers, and researchers familiar Python* tools and frameworks to
accelerate end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines on Intel®
architectures. The components are built using oneAPI libraries for low-level
compute optimizations.

The Intel AI Tools maximize performance from preprocessing
through machine learning, and provide interoperability for efficient model
development.
