# End-to-end samples for Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit)

The Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit (AI Kit) gives data scientists, AI
developers, and researchers familiar Python* tools and frameworks to
accelerate end-to-end data science and analytics pipelines on Intel®
architectures. The components are built using oneAPI libraries for low-level
compute optimizations. This toolkit maximizes performance from preprocessing
through machine learning, and provides interoperability for efficient model
development.
