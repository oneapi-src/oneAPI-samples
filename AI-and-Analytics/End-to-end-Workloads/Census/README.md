# End-to-end Machine Learning Workload: `Census` Sample

This sample code illustrates how to use Intel® Distribution of Modin* for ETL operations and ridge regression algorithm from the Intel® extension of scikit-learn library to build and run an end to end machine learning workload. Both Intel Distribution of Modin* and  Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn libraries are available together in [Intel&reg; oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html). This sample code demonstrates how to seamlessly run the end-to-end census workload using the toolkit, without any external dependencies.

## Purpose
Intel Distribution of Modin* uses Ray to provide an effortless way to speed up your Pandas notebooks, scripts and libraries. Unlike other distributed DataFrame libraries, Intel Distribution of Modin* provides seamless integration and compatibility with existing Pandas code. Intel(R) Extension for Scikit-learn dynamically patches scikit-learn estimators to use Intel(R) oneAPI Data Analytics Library as the underlying solver, while getting the same solution faster.

#### Model and dataset
In this sample, you will use Intel Distribution of Modin* to ingest and process U.S. census data from 1970 to 2010 in order to build a ridge regression based model to find the relation between education and the total income earned in the US.
Data transformation stage normalizes the income to the yearly inflation, balances the data such that each year has a similar number of data points, and extracts the features from the transformed dataset. The feature vectors are fed into the ridge regression model to predict the education of each sample.

Dataset is from IPUMS USA, University of Minnesota, [www.ipums.org](https://ipums.org/) (Steven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer, Jose Pacas and Matthew Sobek. IPUMS USA: Version 10.0 [dataset]. Minneapolis, MN: IPUMS, 2020. https://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V10.0)

## Key Implementation Details
This end-to-end workload sample code is implemented for CPU using the Python language.  With the installation of Intel AI Analytics Toolkit, the conda environment is prepared with Python version 3.7, Intel Distribution of Modin* , Ray, Intel® Extension for Scikit-Learn, NumPy following which the sample code can be directly run using the underlying steps in this README.

## Building Intel Distribution of Modin* and Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn for CPU to build and run end-to-end workload
Intel Distribution of Modin* and Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn is ready for use once you finish the Intel AI Analytics Toolkit installation with the Conda Package Manager.

You can refer to the oneAPI [main page](https://software.intel.com/en-us/oneapi), and the Intel® oneAPI Toolkit [Installation Guide](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/installation-guide-for-intel-oneapi-toolkits-linux/top/installation/install-using-package-managers/conda/install-intel-ai-analytics-toolkit-via-conda.html) for conda environment setup and installation steps.

### Activate conda environment

To install the Intel® Distribution of Modin* python environment, use the following command:
#### Linux
```
conda create -y -n intel-aikit-modin intel-aikit-modin -c intel
```
Then activate your conda environment with the following command:
```
conda activate intel-aikit-modin
```

Additionally, install the following in the conda environment

### Install Jupyter Notebook
Needed to launch Jupyter Notebook in the directory housing the code example
```
conda install jupyter nb_conda_kernels
```

### opencensus
```
pip install opencensus
```

#### View in Jupyter Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook in the directory housing the code example
```
jupyter notebook
```
## Running the end-to-end code sample
### Run as Jupyter Notebook
Open .ipynb file and run cells in Jupyter Notebook using the "Run" button. Alternatively, the entire workbook can be run using the "Restart kernel and re-run whole notebook" button. (see image below using "census modin" sample)

### Using Visual Studio Code*  (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the Generate Launch Configurations extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

After learning how to use the extensions for Intel oneAPI Toolkits, return to this readme for instructions on how to build and run a sample.
