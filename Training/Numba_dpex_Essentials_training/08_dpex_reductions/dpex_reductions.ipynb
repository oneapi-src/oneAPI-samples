    "Naive parallel kernel do not allow for performance optimizations at a hardware level. In these next two kernels we will utilize ND-Range kernels as a way to expresses parallelism enabling low level performance tuning by providing access to both global and local memory and mapping executions to compute units on hardware. The entire iteration space is divided into smaller groups called work-groups, work-items are organized into these work-groups and are scheduled on a single compute unit on the hardware.  Workgroup size must divide the entire ND-range size exactly in each dimension.  These sizes can all vary by hardware platform and by using the device queries below a developer can identify what is possible.  The workload must be considered to find the best mix of these values.\n",

    "In a parallel algorithm, there is a high degree of reuse, so instead of loading values from global memory each time we can load the values into local memory and perform the computation.  This will reduce the latency of accessing the data values.  The difference between this implementation and the ND-range implementation is the reading is done from global memory in the case of ND-range each time and in this implementation they dat is loaded into local memory and then computed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a work-group begins, the contents of its local memory are uninitialized, and local memory does not persist after a work-group finishes executing. Because of these properties, local memory may only be used for temporary storage while a work-group is executing.  For other devices though, such as many GPU devices, there are dedicated resources for local memory, and on these devices, communicating via local memory should perform better than communicating via global memory.\n",

    "In SYCL’s memory model, local memory is a contiguous region of memory allocated per work group and is visible to all the work items in that group. Local memory is device-only and cannot be accessed from the host. From the perspective offers the device, the local memory is exposed as a contiguous array of a specific types. The maximum available local memory is hardware-specific. The SYCL local memory concept is analogous to CUDA’s shared memory concept.\n",

In the example below numba_dpex.local.array(shape, dtype) is the API used to allocate a static array in the local address space:\n",
