    "## Overview\n",
    "This module introduces occlusion tests (shadow rays) with Intel Embree. \n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how to use an intersection test to propogate a new shadow ray. Also, we demonstrate how to test the result of an occlusion test to a point in the scene. This technique is foundational to further Embree examples constructing monte-carlo pathtracers. There is no image output in this module.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to use a surface intersection result to define the origin of an occlusion cast (shadow ray).\n",
    "* How to move ray origins for ray casts.\n",
    "* How to interpret and use occlusion cast results from `rtcOccluded1(..)`\n",
