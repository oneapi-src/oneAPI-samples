    "Currently in the data-centric space, there is growth in specialized workloads. Each kind of data-centric hardware typically needs to be programmed using different languages and libraries. As there is no common programming language or APIs, this requires maintaining separate code bases. You have to learn a whole set of different tools as there is inconsistent tool support across platforms. Developing software for each hardware platform requires a separate investment, with little ability to reuse that work to target a different architecture. You will also have to consider the requirement of the diverse set of data-centric hardware.\n",
