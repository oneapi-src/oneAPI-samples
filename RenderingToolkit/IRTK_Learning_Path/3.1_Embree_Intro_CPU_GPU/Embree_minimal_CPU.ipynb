    "\n",
    "1. Inspect the **fnct_initializeDevice** function and review the API call [**rtcNewDevice**](https://www.embree.org/api.html#rtcnewdevice) for instantiating a device.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inspect the **fnct_initializeScene** function. Create a triangle mesh geometry, and initialize a single triangle. You can look up geometry types in the API documentation to find out which type expects which buffers. We create buffers directly on the device, but you can also use shared buffers. For shared buffers, special care must be taken to ensure proper alignment and padding. Within the function you can see where the geometry is passed into [**rtcCommitGeometry**](https://www.embree.org/api.html#rtccommitgeometry) and bind the geometry to a scene. Finally, commit the scene to the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inspect the **fnct_castRay** function. Cast a single ray with origin (ox, oy, oz) and direction (dx, dy, dz). The [**rtcInitIntersectContext**](https://www.embree.org/api.html#rtcinitintersectcontext) is created and an intersection is attempted in [**rtcIntersect1**.](https://www.embree.org/api.html#rtcintersect1)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Inspect **int main()** and see the ordering of device and scene initialization, ray cast and intersect, and finally release of scene and devlution.vice);\n"
