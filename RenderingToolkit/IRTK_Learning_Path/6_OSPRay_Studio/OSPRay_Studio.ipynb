    "With this exercise we will interactively render the object provided in the obj folder with OSPRay Studio.  OSPRay Studio is included in the Rendering Toolkit that can be downloaded from [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/rendering-toolkit.html).  Once the Rendering Toolkit is installed, OSPRay Studio can be open from the command prompt with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the command prompt\n",
    "* Set up the environment variables by executing the setvars.bat script.\n",
    " * In Windows usually this script is located in \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Intel\\oneAPI\\setvars.bat\" which path can be copied in the command prompt in the command prompt.  The setvars.bat script can be in a separate folder than the one provided here. If so, navigate to the folder where the setvars.bat is and execute it.\n",
    " * In Linux you can execute the command `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`.\n",
    "* Once the environment variables have been updated, execute \"ospStudio.exe\" in the command prompt to open OSPRay Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main menus we will be working with:\n",

    "* Renderer editor\n",

    "### 2.1. Recommended initial settings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important**: `View` -> `Limit accumulation` = ~ 8 frames so rendering stops after 8 frames.\n",
    "- **Important**: `View` -> `Renderer` -> `maxPathLength` = ~ 9 segments.\n",
    "- **Important**: `View` -> `Framebuffer` -> `Scaling` -> `Scale resolution` ≤ 0.50x to decrease render while setting up scene.\n",
    "- **Important**: `View` -> `Framebuffer` -> `Scaling` -> `Scale Nav resolution` ≤ 0.50x to decrease render while navigating.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `View` -> `Framebuffer` -> Check `floatFormat` to access Denoise in the Post-processing section.\n",
    "- `View` -> `Framebuffer` -> `Post-processing` -> Check `Denoise` to denoise when scene is still.\n",
    "- `View` -> `Framebuffer` -> `Post-processing` -> Uncheck `Denoise nav` to avoid denoising while navigating.\n",
    "- `View` -> `Framebuffer` -> `Scaling` -> `Scale resolution` = ~1.00x  when we want to scene to be rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Light editor:\n",
    "In this menu we will create a new light in the \"new light\" section and select the `sunSky` as type. The name of the light has to be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Renderer editor:\n",
    "There are three different renderers we are going to use in this exercise: `pathtracer`, `scivis` and `ao`. The `pathtracer` renderer provides the highest quality but it is also the more demanding and can influence the interactive user experience. The `scivis` renderer is accurate and fast but does not offer the same lights rendering as pathtracer. Finally, `ao` (as of ambient) provides the fastest interaction with OSPRay studio so this renderer is perfect to perform intermediate adjustments in our approach to the desired final rendered picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "The following three pictures depict these renderers to have visual understanding of their performances:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Renderer = `pathtracer`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/Spaceship_PT.png\" style=\"width:50%\"></img> \n",
    "\n",
    "* Renderer = `scivis`:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/Spaceship_SC.png\" style=\"width:50%\"></img> \n",
    "\n",
    "* Renderer = `ao` (Ambient):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/Spaceship_AO.png\" style=\"width:50%\"></img>\n",
    "-->\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4. Framebuffer editor:\n",
    "The main things to consider for preparing the picture to be rendered are the `Scale resolution` and the `Scale Nav resolution` parameters.  These determine the definition of the render when the perspective is still and while navigating respectively. It is recommended to set a low `Scale Nav resolution` value so computational resources are saved to render temporal perspectives while navigating. Advised initial values  for `Scale resolution` and the `Scale Nav resolution` are 0.50x and 0.25x respectively that can be gradually increased based on the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Denoising can be applied by activating `floatFormat` and then by activating `Denoise`.  Consider that `Denoise nav` usually is not required and `Denoise` alone would be sufficient to achieve a good balance between performance and user interactivity."
