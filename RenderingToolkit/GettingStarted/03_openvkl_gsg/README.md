# Getting Started Sample for Intel&reg; Rendering Toolkit (Render Kit): Intel&reg; Open Volume Kernel Library (Intel&reg; Open VKL)

Intel&reg; Open Volume Kernel Library (Intel&reg; Open VKL) is a collection of
high-performance volume computation kernels. Improve performance of volume
rendering applications by using performance optimized volume traversal and
sampling functionality for a variety of data formats.

## Versions

1. [CPU](./cpu/) - for Intel64 (x86-64) Host
- This version of the `vklTutorialCPU` program uses a C++11 (or C99) system compiler to target the host processor.
2. [GPU](./gpu/) - for Intel&reg; Arc&trade; Graphics, Intel&reg; Data Center GPU Flex Series, or Intel&reg; Data Center GPU MAX Series or higher (Xe-HPG, Xe-HPC, DG2-128, DG2-512 or higher)
- This `vklTutorialGPU` program uses Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC/C++ Compiler and SYCL* Runtimes to target the GPU.
