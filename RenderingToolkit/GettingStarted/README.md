# Getting Started Samples for IntelÂ® Rendering Toolkit (Render Kit)

The Intel&reg; Rendering Toolkit (Render Kit) is designed to accelerate
photorealistic rendering workloads with rendering and ray-tracing libraries to
create high-performance, high-fidelity visual experiences. You can get the most
from Intel&reg; hardware by optimizing performance at any scale with these
libraries. Creators, scientists, and engineers can push the boundaries of
visualization by using the toolkit to develop studio animation and visual
effects or to create scientific and industrial visualizations.

You can find more information at [Intel&reg; Rendering
Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/rendering-toolkit.html).

## Purpose

The getting started samples demonstrate an ordered source code introduction to
the functionality of Render Kit libraries. These samples supplement the Get
Started Guides:
- [Get Started with the Intel&reg; Rendering Toolkit for
  Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-render-windows/top.html)
- [Get Started with the Intel&reg; Rendering Toolkit for
  Linux](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-render-linux/top.html)
- [Get Started with the Intel&reg; Rendering Toolkit for
  macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-render-macos/top.html)


## Build and Run Render Kit Samples

Try the getting started sample programs in the order shown in the table. The
output of a sample may serve as input for another sample. Use the specific
README.md of each for instructions.

| Order | Component      | Folder                                             | Description |
| -- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | - |
| 1 | Intel OSPRay | [01_ospray_gsg](01_ospray_gsg)                     | Get started with Intel&reg; OSPRay, an open source, scalable, and portable ray tracing engine for high-performance, high-fidelity visualization. |
| 2 | Intel Embree | [02_embree_gsg](02_embree_gsg)| Get started with Intel&reg; Embree, a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels. |
| 3 | Intel Open Volume Kernel Library | [03_openvkl_gsg](03_openvkl_gsg)| Get started with Intel&reg; Open VKL, a collection of high-performance volume computation kernels. |
| 4 | Intel Open Image Denoise | [04_oidn_gsg](04_oidn_gsg) | Get started with Intel&reg; Open Image Denoise, an open source library of high-performance, high-quality, denoising filters for images rendered with ray tracing. |
| 5 | Intel ISPC | [05_ispc_gsg](05_ispc_gsg) | Get started with Intel&reg; Implicit SPMD Program Compiler (Intel&reg; ISPC), the C variant optimizing compiler used in conjunction with the Render Kit libraries. |
