# Getting Started Samples for Intel® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit (RenderKit)

The Intel® oneAPI Rendering Toolkit is designed to accelerate photorealistic rendering workloads with rendering and ray-tracing libraries to create high-performance, high-fidelity visual experiences. With the libraries, get the most from Intel® hardware by optimizing performance at any scale. Creators, scientists, and engineers can push the boundaries of visualization by using the toolkit to develop studio animation and visual effects or to create scientific and industrial visualizations.

You can find more information at the [ Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit portal](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/rendering-toolkit.html).

## Purpose

The getting started samples demonstrate an ordered source code introduction to the functionality of Render Kit libraries.
These samples supplement the Getting Started Guides:
- [Getting Started with the Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit for Windows* OS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-render-windows/top.html)
- [Getting Started with the Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit for Linux* OS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-render-linux/top.html)
- [Getting Started with the Intel oneAPI Rendering Toolkit for MacOS*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-oneapi-render-macos/top.html)
