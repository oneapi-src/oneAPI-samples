## Purpose

This sample relates to the basic usage of components of the Intel System Debugger.

As a first step, please checkout the following git repository:

```git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git```

Then, go to the folder `Tools/SystemDebug`.
The folder contains both source and documentation for how to use these components.

 These are the following:

`efi_application` : example efi application that can be used to demo the functionality of source level debugging.

`docs` : RST documentation for tutorials of components.

`python` : Python code making use of the component python interfaces (if applicable).
