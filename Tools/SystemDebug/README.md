## Purpose

This sample relates to the basic usage of components of the Intel System Debugger.

As a first step, please check out the following git repository:

```git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples.git```

Then, go to the folder `Tools/SystemDebug`
The folder contains both source and documentation for how to use these components.

 These are the following:

`efi_application` : example EFI application that can be used to demo the functionality of source-level debugging.

`docs` : RST documentation for tutorials of components.

`python` : Python code making use of the component python interfaces (if applicable).


### Docs

`EFIAppliction.rst` : Documentation of how to build and flash the EFI application.

`WinDbgSample.rst` : Sample of how to use the `Intel速 Debugger Extension for WinDbg` to debug a real bios.

`TCASample.rst` : Sample of how to use the `Intel速 System Debugger` to connect to a real target.

`SysTraceSample.rst` : Sample of how to use the `Intel速 System Debugger for System Trace` to work with a pre-collected trace file.

`SysDbgSample.rst` : Sample of how to use the `Intel速 System Debugger for System Debug` to work with the example UEFI application provided to debug bare-metal applications.
