## Purpose
The STREAM sample performs the memory bandwidth benchmark.

## Key Implementation Details 
This sample contains a STREAM implementation using DPC++ for CPU and GPU and is a variant of the [STREAM](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/) benchmark code. Please review the license terms regarding publishing benchmarks.”

     3a. In order to be referred to as "STREAM benchmark results",
         published results must be in conformance to the STREAM
         Run Rules, (briefly reviewed below) published at
         http://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/ref.html

     3b. Results based on modified source code or on runs not in
         accordance with the STREAM Run Rules must be clearly
         labelled whenever they are published.  Examples of
         proper labelling include:
         "tuned STREAM benchmark results" 
         "based on a variant of the STREAM benchmark code"
         Other comparable, clear and reasonable labelling is
         acceptable.
     
     3c. Submission of results to the STREAM benchmark web site
         is encouraged, but not required.

## Building the `STREAM` Program for CPU and GPU

### On a Linux* System 

Perform the following steps:

> Note: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI environment by sourcing 
>    the setvars script located in the root of your oneAPI installation.  
>     
>   Linux (sudo): `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`  
>   Linux (user): `~/intel/oneapi/ setvars.sh`  

1. Build the program using the following `cmake` commands. 
``` 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```
2. Run the program (default uses buffers):
    ```
    make run
    ```
3. Clean the program using:
    ```
    make clean
    ```

## Running the Sample
```
./stream_sycl.exe
```

### Example of Output
```
$ ./stream_sycl.exe
SYCL Platform: Intel(R) Level-Zero
SYCL Device:   Intel(R) Graphics Gen9 [0x3ea5]
-------------------------------------------------------------
STREAM version $Revision: 5.10 $
-------------------------------------------------------------
This system uses 8 bytes per array element.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Array size = 134217728 (elements), Offset = 0 (elements)
Memory per array = 1024.0 MiB (= 1.0 GiB).
Total memory required = 3072.0 MiB (= 3.0 GiB).
Each kernel will be executed 20 times.
 The *best* time for each kernel (excluding the first iteration)
 will be used to compute the reported bandwidth.
-------------------------------------------------------------
Your clock granularity/precision appears to be 1 microseconds.
Each test below will take on the order of 95882 microseconds.
   (= 95882 clock ticks)
Increase the size of the arrays if this shows that
you are not getting at least 20 clock ticks per test.
-------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING -- The above is only a rough guideline.
For best results, please be sure you know the
precision of your system timer.
