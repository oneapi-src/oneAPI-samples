# `jacobi` Sample

The 'jacobi' code sample is a small DPC++ code sample for exercising application
debugging using Intel&reg; Distribution for GDB\*. It is highly recommended that
you go through this sample *after* you familiarize yourself with the
[array-transform](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneAPI-samples/tree/master/Tools/ApplicationDebugger/array-transform)
sample and the
[Get Started Guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-debugging-dpcpp)
for the debugger.

This sample contains two versions of the same program: `jacobi-bugged` and
`jacobi-fixed`. The former works correctly, but in the latter, several bugs were
injected. You can try to find and fix them using the debugger.

## Purpose

The `jacobi` sample is a DPC++ application that solves a hardcoded linear system
of equations `Ax=b` using the Jacobi iteration. The matrix `A` is an `n x n` sparse
matrix with diagonals `[1 1 5 1 1]`. Vectors `b` and `x` are `n x 1` vectors.
Vector `b` is set in the way that all components of the solution vector `x` are 1.

The program `jacobi-fixed` computes vector `x` correctly. That is, all
components of the resulting vector are close to 1.0. However, `jacobi-bugged`
returns an incorrect result. With the debugger, you can put a breakpoint in and
outside of the kernel, step through the code, and check the values of local
variables. Use these features to find places in `jacobi-bugged` where the
program does not behave as it was intended.

The sample is intended for exercising the debugger, not for performance
benchmarking.

The debugger supports debugging kernels that run on the CPU, GPU, or accelerator
devices. For convenience, the `jacobi` code sample provides the ability to
select the target device by using a command-line argument of `cpu`, `gpu`, or
`accelerator`.

The selected device is displayed in the output. For the overview of the
debugger, please refer to the
[Get Started Guide](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-debugging-dpcpp)
of the application debugger.

## Key Implementation Details

The basic DPC++ implementation explained in the code includes device selection,
buffer, accessor, and command groups.

Each iteration of the Jacobi method performs the following computation:

```
x^{k+1} = D^{-1}(b - (A - D)x^k),
```

where `n x n` matrix `D` is a diagonal component of the matrix `A`. In the
sample, this computation is offloaded to the device at each iteration. In the
code, `x^{k+1}` corresponds to the variable `x_k1`, and `x^k` corresponds to
`x_k`. At the end of each iteration, we update `x_k` with the value of `x_k1`.

## Building and Running the `jacobi` Project

If you have not already done so, set up your CLI environment by sourcing
the setvars script located in the root of your oneAPI installation.

Linux Sudo: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
Linux User: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
Windows: `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`

### Setup

Preliminary setup steps are needed for the debugger to function. Please see the
setup instructions in the Get Started Guide based on your OS:
[Linux](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-debugging-dpcpp-linux),
[Windows](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-debugging-dpcpp-windows).


### Include Files

The include folder is located at `%ONEAPI_ROOT%\dev-utilities\latest\include` on
your development system.


### Running Samples In DevCloud

If running a sample in the Intel DevCloud, remember that you must specify the
compute node (CPU, GPU, FPGA) and whether to run in batch or interactive mode.
We recommend running the `jacobi` sample on a node with GPU. In order to have an
interactive debugging session, we recommend using the interactive mode. To get
the setting, after connecting to the login node, type the following command:

```
$ qsub -I -l nodes=1:gpu:ppn=2
```
Within the interactive session on the GPU node, build and run the sample.
For more information, see the IntelÂ® oneAPI Base Toolkit Get Started Guide
(https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get-started/base-toolkit/).

### On a Linux* System

Perform the following steps:

1.  Build the project using the following `cmake` commands.

    ```
    $ cd jacobi
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    ```

    This builds both `jacobi-bugged` and `jacoby-fixed` versions of the program.
    > Note: The cmake configuration enforces the `Debug` build type.

2.  Run the buggy program:

    ```
    $ ./jacobi-bugged <device>
    ```

    > Note: `<device>` is the type of the device to offload the kernel.
    > Use `cpu`, `gpu`, or `accelerator` to select the CPU, GPU, or the
    > FPGA emulator device, respectively.  E.g.:

    ```
    $ ./jacobi-bugged cpu
    ```

3.  Start a debugging session:

    ```
    $ gdb-oneapi --args jacobi-bugged <device>
    ```

4.  Clean the program using:

    ```
    $ make clean
    ```

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio* Version 2017 or Newer

#### Command line using MSBuild

* `set CL_CONFIG_USE_NATIVE_DEBUGGER=1`
* `MSBuild lacobi.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="debug"`

#### Visual Studio IDE

1. Right-click on the solution files and open via either Visual Studio 2017 or
   in 2019.

2. Open in Visual Studio "Tools > Options > Debugging > General" and ensure that
   "Require source files to exactly match the original version" Debugging option
   is **not** checked.
   ![](vs-debugger-option.png)

3. Select Menu "Build > Build Solution" to build the selected configuration.

4. Select Menu "Debug > Start Debugging" to run the program, the default startup
   project is `jacobi-bugged`.

5. The solution file is configured to pass `cpu` as the argument to the program
   while using "Local Windows Debugger", and `gpu` while using "Remote Windows
   Debugger". To select a different device, go to the project's "Configuration
   Properties > Debugging" and set the "Command Arguments" field. Use `gpu` or
   `accelerator` to target the GPU or the FPGA emulator device, respectively.

For detailed instructions about starting and using the debugger, please see the
[Get Started Guide (Windows)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-with-debugging-dpcpp-windows).
