## Purpose

The Matrix Multiplication sample performs basic matrix multiplication. Three versions are provided that use different SYCL features.

## Key Implementation details

The basic SYCL implementation explained in the code includes device selector, buffer, accessor, kernel, and command groups.

## How to Build

### Setting Environment Variables
When working with the Command Line Interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script located in the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: `. ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `$ bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files(x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - For Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> Microsoft Visual Studio:
> - Open a command prompt window and execute `setx SETVARS_CONFIG " "`. This only needs to be set once and will automatically execute the `setvars` script every time Visual Studio is launched.
>
>For more information on environment variables, see "Use the setvars Script" for [Linux or macOS](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html), or [Windows](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html).

You can use [Modulefiles scripts](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-modulefiles-with-linux.html) to set up your development environment. The modulefiles scripts work with all Linux shells.

If you wish to fine tune the list of components and the version of those components, use
a [setvars config file](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos/use-a-config-file-for-setvars-sh-on-linux-or-macos.html) to set up your development environment.

## Using Visual Studio Code* (Optional)

You can use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) extensions to set your environment,
create launch configurations, and browse and download samples.

The basic steps to build and run a sample using VS Code include:
 - Download a sample using the extension **Code Sample Browser for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Configure the oneAPI environment with the extension **Environment Configurator for Intel&reg; oneAPI Toolkits**.
 - Open a Terminal in VS Code (**Terminal>New Terminal**).
 - Run the sample in the VS Code terminal using the instructions below.
 - (Linux only) Debug your GPU application with GDB for Intel® oneAPI toolkits using the **Generate Launch Configurations** extension.

To learn more about the extensions, see the
[Using Visual Studio Code with Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/using-vs-code-with-intel-oneapi/top.html).

This sample contains three versions of matrix multiplication:

- `multiply1` – basic implementation of matrix multiply using SYCL
- `multiply1_1` – basic implementation that replaces the buffer store with a local accessor “acc” to reduce memory traffic
- `multiply1_2` – the basic implementation, plus adding the local accessor and matrix tiling

Edit the line in `src/multiply.hpp` to select the version of the multiply function:
`#define MULTIPLY multiply1`.

### On a Linux* System
	To build the SYCL version:
	cd <sample dir>
	cmake .
	make

    Clean the program
    make clean

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
``make VERBOSE=1``
For more comprehensive troubleshooting, use the Diagnostics Utility for
Intel® oneAPI Toolkits, which provides system checks to find missing
dependencies and permissions errors.

### On a Windows* System Using Visual Studio 2017 or newer
   * Open Visual Studio 2017
   * Select Menu "File > Open > Project/Solution", find "matrix_multiply" folder and select "matrix_multiply.sln"
   * Select Menu "Project > Build" to build the selected configuration
   * Select Menu "Debug > Start Without Debugging" to run the program

### On Windows - command line - Build the program using MSBuild
    DPCPP Configurations:
    Release - MSBuild matrix_multiply.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Release"
    Debug - MSBuild matrix_multiply.sln /t:Rebuild /p:Configuration="Debug"



### Example of Output
```
./matrix.dpcpp

Using multiply kernel: multiply1

Running on Intel(R) Gen9

Elapsed Time: 0.539631s
```

## Running an Intel&reg; Advisor analysis
See the [Intel® Advisor Cookbook](https://software.intel.com/en-us/advisor-cookbook).

### Build and run additional samples
Several sample programs are available for you to try, many of which can be compiled and run in a similar fashion to this sample. Experiment with running the various samples on different kinds of compute nodes or adjust their source code to experiment with different workloads.
