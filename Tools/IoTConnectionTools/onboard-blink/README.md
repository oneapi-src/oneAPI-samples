# `Onboard Blink` Sample

## Introduction
This is a simple sample you could use for a quick IoT board test.

## What it is
A blink sample, it turns the on-board LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

## Hardware requirements
A board with an on-board LED or an accessible GPIO pin (connected to a LED).

## Supported boards
This sample has been tested on
- [UP Squared\* AI Vision Kit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/up-squared-ai-vision-dev-kit)
- [IEI\* Tank AIoT Developer Kit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/iei-tank-dev-kit-core)

The sample might need minor modifications depending on the board, pin and shield you are using.

## Software requirements
This sample is supported on Linux systems only.

This version of the sample has been tested on Ubuntu Linux. It requires the [Eclipse* MRAA library](https://github.com/eclipse/mraa).

This sample requires additional system configuration when using Ubuntu OS with the UP series boards. Instructions on installing the custom provided Linux kernel with the required drivers can be [found here](https://wiki.up-community.org/Ubuntu#Ubuntu_18.04_installation_and_configuration).

## Setup
Create a new project using the Eclipse* IDE and after installing the IntelÂ® oneAPI IoT Toolkit. Make sure the on-board LED, or the external LED is connected to the board.

## Note
Accessing device sensors, including LEDs, requires MRAA I/O operations. Mraa I/O operations require permissions to UNIX character devices and sysfs classes not commonly granted to normal users by default.
To learn how to use I/O devices from userspace with the UP series boards, refer to [this link](https://wiki.up-community.org/Ubuntu#Enable_the_HAT_functionality_from_userspace).
