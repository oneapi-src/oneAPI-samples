# Digital Out

## Introduction
This is a simple sample you could use for a quick test of digital output.

## What it is

This project demonstrates how to write a value to an output pin using the Eclipse* MRAA library.

## Hardware requirements
A board with an accessible GPIO output pin.
A digital output device or sensor such as a 'Relay' or 'LED' in Starter Kits.

## Supported boards
This sample has been tested on
- [UP Squared\* AI Vision Kit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/up-squared-ai-vision-dev-kit)
- [IEI\* Tank AIoT Developer Kit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/iei-tank-dev-kit-core)

The sample might need minor modifications depending on the board and shield you are using.

## Software requirements
This sample is supported on Linux systems only.

This version of the sample has been tested on Ubuntu Linux. It requires the [Eclipse* MRAA library](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa).

This sample requires additional system configuration when using Ubuntu OS with the UP series boards. Instructions on how to install the custom provided Linux kernel with the required drivers can be [found here](https://wiki.up-community.org/Ubuntu#Ubuntu_18.04_installation_and_configuration).

## Setup
Create a new project using this sample in Eclipse* IDE and after installing the IntelÂ® oneAPI IoT Toolkit. 
Connect the output device to a digital output pin on your IoT board.

## Note
Accessing device sensors, including LEDs, requires MRAA I/O operations. Mraa I/O operations require permissions to UNIX character devices and sysfs classes not commonly granted to normal users by default.
To learn how to use I/O devices from user space with the UP series boards refer to [this link](https://wiki.up-community.org/Ubuntu#Enable_the_HAT_functionality_from_userspace).
