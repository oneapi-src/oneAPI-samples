# Hello IoT World

## Introduction
This is a simple sample you could use for a quick compiler test.

## What it is
This project outputs a "Hello World" message and lets users know if the Intel速 C++ Compiler Classic was used
to compile the code sample.

## Hardware requirements
Any Intel速 CPU

## Software requirements
Intel速 C++ Compiler Classic

## How to build and run
### Linux CLI
Use the `oneapi-cli` utility from a terminal to download and create the sample at a location of your choice.
Source the `setvars.sh` script distributed with oneAPI to configure the compiler. By default this can be found under
`/opt/intel/inteloneapi`.
Use the following commands to build and run the sample:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make run
```
### Windows CLI
Use the `oneapi-cli.exe` utility from a `Developer Command Prompt for VS` to download and create the sample at a location of your choice.

*Note:* On Windows systems you will need "MSBuild Tools", "Windows 10 SDK" and "C++ CMake tools for Windows" as part of your installed Visual Studio components.

Source the `setvars.bat` script distributed with oneAPI to configure the compiler. By default this can be found under
`"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI"`.
Use the following commands to build and run the sample:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
nmake
nmake run
```
### IDE
Use the Samples Plugin for Eclipse or Visual Studio to create and run the sample.

You may need to source the `setvars` script distributed with oneAPI before launching the IDE to use the Intel速 C++ Compiler Classic or make it available as a toolchain in the IDE.
