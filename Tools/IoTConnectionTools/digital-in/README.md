# `Digital In` Sample

## Introduction
This is a simple sample you could use for a quick test of digital input.

## What it is
This project demonstrates how to read a digital value from an input pin using the MRAA library.

## Hardware requirements
A board with an accessible GPIO input pin.
A digital input device or sensor such as the 'Button' or 'Touch Sensor' in Starter Kits.

## Supported boards
This sample has been tested on
- [UP Squared\* AI Vision Kit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/up-squared-ai-vision-dev-kit)
- [IEI\* Tank AIoT Developer Kit](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/iei-tank-dev-kit-core)

The sample might need minor modifications depending on the board and shield you are using.

## Software requirements
This sample is supported on Linux systems only.

This version of the sample has been tested on Ubuntu Linux. It requires the [Eclipse* MRAA library](https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/mraa).

This sample requires additional system configuration when using Ubuntu OS with the UP series boards. Instructions on installing the custom provided Linux kernel with the required drivers can be [found here](https://wiki.up-community.org/Ubuntu#Ubuntu_18.04_installation_and_configuration).

## Setup
Create a new project using the Eclipse* IDE and install the IntelÂ® oneAPI IoT Toolkit.
Connect the input device to a digital input pin on your IoT board.

## Note
Accessing device sensors, including LEDs, requires MRAA I/O operations. Mraa I/O operations require permissions to UNIX character devices and sysfs classes not commonly granted to normal users by default.
To learn how to use I/O devices from userspace with the UP series boards, refer to [this link](https://wiki.up-community.org/Ubuntu#Enable_the_HAT_functionality_from_userspace).
