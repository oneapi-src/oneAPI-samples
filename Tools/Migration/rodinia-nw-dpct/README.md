The program, `needleman-Wunsch`, naively implements the [Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm][nw-algorithm], which is used in bioinformatics to align protein and
nucleotide sequences. The code is based on [Rodinia][rodinia], a set of
benchmarks for heterogeneous computing. As compared to the `Intel DPC++
Compatibility Tool: Vector Add` sample, this sample represents a more typical
example of migrating a working project.

If your project uses Make or CMake, you can use compilation database support to
provide compilation options, settings, macro definitions, and include paths to
the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool. The compilations database is a JSON* file
containing the commands required to build a particular project. You can generate
a compilation database by running the intercept-build script described below.


## Key Implementation Details

Use the `intercept-build` tool to automatically generate a compilation
database in a JSON file that contains the build commands for the Intel DPC++
Compatibility Tool to use. Migrate the project and prepare the project to
build and run using the Intel&reg; oneAPI DPC++ Compiler

## Migrating the CUDA Sample to Data Parallel C++ with the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool

Building and running the CUDA sample is not required to migrate this project
to a Data Parallel C++ project.

> **NOTE:** Certain CUDA header files, referenced by the CUDA application
> source files to be migrated, need to be accessible for the migration step.
> See the [Getting Started Guide][cuda-headers] for more details.

### On a Linux* System

1. Ensure your environment is configured to use the oneAPI tools.

```sh
$ source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```

2. Generate a [compilation database](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html)
   for the project using `intercept-build`. The compilation database is a
   listing of all compilation commands invoked during the build process. The
   `dpct` utility uses this information to determine the files to process.

```sh
$ make clean
$ intercept-build make
```
   This creates the file `compile_commands.json` in the working directory.

3. Use the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool and compilation database to migrate
   the CUDA code. The new project will be created in the `migration` directory.

```sh
$ dpct -p compile_commands.json --in-root=. --out-root=migration
```

4. Inspect the migrated source code, address any `DPCT` warnings generated
   by the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool, and verify the new program correctness.

Warnings are printed to the console and added as comments inside the migrated
source files. See the [Diagnostic Reference][diag-ref] for more information on
what each warning means.

[diag-ref]: <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-dpcpp-compatibility-tool/top/diagnostics-reference.html>

This sample should generate the following warning messages:
```
warning: DPCT1003:0: Migrated API does not return error code. (*, 0) is inserted. You may need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1043:1: The version-related API is different in SYCL. An initial code was generated, but you need to adjust it.
warning: DPCT1009:2: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error codes. The original code was commented out and a warning string was inserted. You need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1009:3: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error codes. The original code was commented out and a warning string was inserted. You need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1049:4: The workgroup size passed to the SYCL kernel may exceed the limit. To get the device limit, query info::device::max_work_group_size. Adjust the workgroup size if needed.
warning: DPCT1049:5: The workgroup size passed to the SYCL kernel may exceed the limit. To get the device limit, query info::device::max_work_group_size. Adjust the workgroup size if needed.
```

See the section titled **Addressing Warnings in Migrated Code** below to
understand how to resolve the warnings.

5. Copy the original `Makefile` into the `migration` folder and update the
   copy to build the migrated project using DPC++. Replace the CUDA
   configurations in that new `Makefile` with the following for use with DPC++:

```make
CXX = dpcpp
TARGET = needleman_wunsch_dpcpp
SRCS = src/needle.dp.cpp
DEPS = src/needle_kernel.dp.cpp src/needle.h

# The remainder of the makefile should work without changes.
```

6. Switch to the migration directory: `cd migration`.

7. Build the migrated sample: `make`.

If you have not addressed all of the warnings, the compilation step will fail
for this sample due to some code that could not be migrated by the `dpct`
utility. You should see a compilation error similar to the following:
```
error: assigning to 'int' from incompatible type 'typename info::param_traits<info::device, (device)4143U>::return_type' (aka 'basic_string<char>')

```

8. After you have fixed the migrated source files, build and run the migrated
   sample using: `make run`. You should see logs indicating that the matrix is
   being processed.

9. Clean up the build: `make clean`.


## Windows

1. Open the migration wizard at `Extensions` > `Intel` > `Migrate Project to DPC++`
   and choose the `needleman-wunsch.vcxproj` project.

2. Configure and run the migration. Use the default settings to create a new
   project, which will be added to the open solution.

Note the generated command-line invocation. You can run this from the command
line as long as you first initialize your environment with:

```sh
"C:\Program Files (x86)\intel\oneapi\setvars.bat"
```

3. Inspect the generated source code and address any `DPCT` warnings generated
   by the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool. Warnings appear in a tool window and
   are written to a `migration.log` file in the project directory.

This sample should generate the following warning messages:
```
warning: DPCT1003:0: Migrated API does not return error code. (*, 0) is inserted. You may need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1043:1: The version-related API is different in SYCL. An initial code was generated, but you need to adjust it.
warning: DPCT1009:2: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error codes. The original code was commented out and a warning string was inserted. You need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1009:3: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error codes. The original code was commented out and a warning string was inserted. You need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1049:4: The workgroup size passed to the SYCL kernel may exceed the limit. To get the device limit, query info::device::max_work_group_size. Adjust the workgroup size if needed.
warning: DPCT1049:5: The workgroup size passed to the SYCL kernel may exceed the limit. To get the device limit, query info::device::max_work_group_size. Adjust the workgroup size if needed.
```

See the section titled **Addressing Warnings in Migrated Code** below to
understand how to resolve the warnings.

4. Address any compilation issues and then build and run the migrated project
   by right-clicking the project in the solution explorer, selecting it as the
   startup project, and running it with the green play button in the top bar.


# Addressing Warnings in Migrated Code

Migration generated warnings based on code that DPCT could not migrate:
```
warning: DPCT1003:0: Migrated API does not return error code. (*, 0) is inserted. You may need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1043:1: The version-related API is different in SYCL. An initial code was generated, but you need to adjust it.
warning: DPCT1009:2: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error codes. The original code was commented out and a warning string was inserted. You need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1009:3: SYCL uses exceptions to report errors and does not use the error codes. The original code was commented out and a warning string was inserted. You need to rewrite this code.
warning: DPCT1049:4: The workgroup size passed to the SYCL kernel may exceed the limit. To get the device limit, query info::device::max_work_group_size. Adjust the workgroup size if needed.
warning: DPCT1049:5: The workgroup size passed to the SYCL kernel may exceed the limit. To get the device limit, query info::device::max_work_group_size. Adjust the workgroup size if needed.
```


## Resolve the DPCT1003, DPCT1009, and DPCT1043

First, start with the warnings specific to `needle.dp.cpp` located in the
migrated source directory.

In this case, the original CUDA call `cudaDriverGetVersion` was migrated to an
equivalent DPC++ construct. However, because CUDA uses error codes while DPC++
uses exceptions to handle errors, `dpct` added the DPCT1003 message in the
comments to indicate that additional manual edits are likely required. The
same call also resulted in message DPCT1043, which warns that the device
version has a different meaning versus the CUDA driver version. Lastly, the `if`
statement that checks the error code results in DPCT1009.

To manually resolve these issues:
-	since the error codes are not needed, you can remove code related to them.
-	since the SYCL device version api is different, you need to update this code.

Replace the following lines from `needle.dp.cpp`.

```cpp
int version = 0;
int err_code = 999;
/* ...dpct generated comments... */
err_code =
    (version =
        dpct::get_current_device().get_info<sycl::info::device::version>(),
     0);
if (err_code != 0)
/* ...dpct generated comments... */
    printf("Error \\"%s\\" checking driver version: %s.\\n",
    "cudaGetErrorName not supported" /*cudaGetErrorName(err_code)*/,
    "cudaGetErrorString not supported" /*cudaGetErrorString(err_code)*/);
else
    printf("CUDA driver version: %d.%d\n", version/1000, version%1000/10);
```

Replace with:

```cpp
    std::string version = dpct::get_current_device().get_info<sycl::info::device::version>();
    printf("SYCL device version: %s\n", version.c_str());

```

After the code is fixed, save the file in the text editor.


## Resolve DPCT1049

This DPCT message appears twice in `needle.dp.cpp`, and it simply warns that
the maximum workgroup size for your GPU may be different from the CUDA limit.
If you examine the code, we are running workgroup sizes of `BLOCK_SIZE=16`
which is well under the limit of all GPUs. This message can be safely ignored.


## Check Migration of Code using Variables Declared in Preprocessor Directives

In some cases, where variables are declared using preprocessor directives,
`dpct` may replace the code with the value derived from the preprocessor
directive. This occurred in four lines of this migration.

In `needle.dp.cpp`, search for the variables `temp_range_ct1` and
`ref_range_ct1`. Find the lines that include the `/*BLOCK_SIZE*/` comments
inserted by `dpct`, like these:

```cpp
sycl::range<2> temp_range_ct1(17 /*BLOCK_SIZE+1*/, 17 /*BLOCK_SIZE+1*/);
sycl::range<2> ref_range_ct1(16 /*BLOCK_SIZE*/, 16 /*BLOCK_SIZE*/);
```

and change the code to look like the following:

```cpp
sycl::range<2> temp_range_ct1(BLOCK_SIZE+1, BLOCK_SIZE+1);
sycl::range<2> ref_range_ct1(BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE);
```


## Modify the Block Size

Open `needle.h`, also located in the migrated source directory.

The equivalent of a CUDA block is an SYCL workgroup in DPC++. The maximum size
of a block for a CUDA-enabled device may be different than the maximum size of
a work-group for a SYCL-enabled device. You can use `clinfo` to get information
about the max workgroup size available on your system. Often the block
size needs to be adjusted for functionality and performance.

In this application, you can try changing the BLOCK_SIZE in needle.h.


# Example Output

Once you have correctly completed the migration and provided the new makefile
to the migrated project, you will be able to build and run the
project to get the following output.

```
./needleman_wunsch_dpcpp 4096 16
WG size of kernel = 128
Start Needleman-Wunsch
Processing top-left matrix
Processing bottom-right matrix
```
