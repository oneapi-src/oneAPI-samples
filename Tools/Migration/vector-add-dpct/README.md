# Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool: Vector Add Sample

This sample demonstrates how to migrate a simple program from CUDA to 
Data Parallel C++. Vector Add provides an easy way to verify that
your development environment is setup correctly to use the IntelÂ® DPC++
Compatibility Tool (dpct).


| Optimized for         | Description
|:---                   |:---
| OS                    | Linux* Ubuntu* 18.04; Windows 10
| Software              | Intel&reg; DPC++ Compatibility Tool;
| What you will learn   | Simple invocation of dpct to migrate CUDA code
| Time to complete      | 10 minutes


## Purpose

This simple project adds two vectors of `[1..N]` and prints the result of that
addition. It starts as a CUDA project in order to provide you with an example
of how to migrate from an existing CUDA project to a Data Parallel C++
project.

The migration of existing CUDA projects to Data Parallel C++ projects may
result in warnings which are printed to the console and added as comments in
the migrated source, which will use .dp.cpp file extensions. Warnings represent
areas in the resulting source code that require additional attention from the
developer. This is because the code could not be migrated by the tool or some
other reasons that require additional review and manual work in order for the
code to be Data Parallel C++ compliant, correct, or performant. For this sample,
the warning is the result of difference in how the original code and generated
code handle errors.


## Key Implementation Details

In addition to verifying that the necessary tools and files are installed and
configured correctly on your system, this sample shows the basic invocation
and work flow for using dpct.

## Migrating the CUDA Sample to Data Parallel C++ with the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool

Building and running the CUDA sample is not required to migrate this project
to a Data Parallel C++ project.

> **NOTE:** Certain CUDA header files, referenced by the CUDA application 
> source files to be migrated, need to be accessible for the migration step.  
> See the [Getting Started Guide][cuda-headers] for more details.

### Command Line On a Linux* System

1. Ensure your environment is configured to use the OneAPI tools.

```sh
$ source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
```

2. Use dpct to migrate the CUDA code. The  migrated source code will be 
   created in a new directory, by default named `dpct_output`. 

```sh
# From the repo root directory:
$ dpct --in-root=. src/vector_add.cu
```

3. Inspect the migrated source code, address any `DPCT` warnings generated 
   by the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool, and verify the new program correctness.

Warnings are printed to the console and added as comments in the migrated
source. See the [Diagnostic Reference][diag-ref] for more information on what
each warning means.

[diag-ref]: <https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-dpcpp-compatibility-tool/top/diagnostics-reference.html>

This sample should generate the following warning:

```
warning: DPCT1003:0: Migrated API does not return error code. (*, 0) is inserted. You may need to rewrite this code.
```

See the section titled **Addressing Warnings in Migrated Code** below to
understand how to resolve the warnings.

4. Copy the original `Makefile` into the `dpct_output` folder and update the
   copy to build the migrated project using DPC++. Replace the CUDA
   configurations in that new `Makefile` with the following for use with DPC++:

```make
CXX = dpcpp
TARGET = vector_add
SRCS = src/vector_add.dp.cpp

# The remainder of the Makefile should work without changes.
```
5. Switch to the migration directory with `cd dpct_output`

6. Build the migrated sample with the `make` command.

7. Run the migrated sample with the `make run` command. You should see a block
   of even numbers, indicating the result of adding two vectors:
   `[1..N] + [1..N]`.

8. Clean up the build with the `make clean` command.


## Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows

1. Open the migration wizard at `Extensions` > `Intel` > `Migrate Project to DPC++`
   and choose the `vector-add.vcxproj` project.

2. Configure and run the migration. Use the default settings to create a new
   project, which will be added to the open solution.

Notice the migrated command line invocation. You can run this from the command
line as long as you first initialize your environment with:

```sh
"C:\Program Files (x86)\intel\oneapi\setvars.bat"
```

3. Inspect the migrated source code and address any `DPCT` warnings generated
   by the Intel DPC++ Compatibility Tool. Warnings appear in a tool window and
   are written to a `migration.log` file in the project directory.

This sample should generate the following warning:

```
warning: DPCT1003:0: Migrated API does not return error code. (*, 0) is inserted. You may need to rewrite this code.
```
See below **Addressing Warnings in the Migrated Code** to understand how to resolve the warning.

4. Build and run the migrated project by right clicking the project in the
   solution explorer, selecting it as the startup project, and running it with
   the green play button in the top bar.


# Addressing Warnings in Migrated Code

Migration generated one warning for code that `dpct` could not migrate:

```
warning: DPCT1003:0: Migrated API does not return error code. (*, 0) is inserted. You may need to rewrite this code.
```

Since DPC++ uses exceptions rather than error codes for error handling, the
tool removed the conditional statement to exit on failure and instead wrapped
the code in a `try` block. However, `dpct` retained the error status variable
and changed the source to always assign an error code of `0` to it. One way to
address the associated migration comment would be to remove the status
variable entirely.

To manually resolve the issue, simply remove the variable `status`, since it
is not needed.


# Example Output

When you run the migrated application you should see console output which
lists a group of even numbers produced by the kernel code's execution of
`((index+1) + (index+1))`.

```
