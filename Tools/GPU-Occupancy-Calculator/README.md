# Intel(R) GPU Occupancy Calculator

## Purpose

Intel GPU Occupancy Calculator is HTML Web Application to compute GPU Occupancy
for GPU/HPC application development.

## Tool Details

* Allows user to pick a GPU SKU, input Global Size of HPC application,
  Work-Group(WG) size, Sub-Group size, Shared Local Memory(SLM) size and barrier
  usage.
* Computes Sub-Slice/Dual Sub-Slice (SS/DSS) Theoretical Occupancy based
  on the inputs.
* Generates charts for Impact of varying Work-Group size and
  Impact of varying Shared Local Memory size.
* Generates a list of all valid
  Work-Group sizes that can be used and corresponding Occupancy.
* Generates a list of optimal configuration values for WG, SG and SLM limit that
  will get 100% Occupancy.

## Usage
* Open Page: [oneapi-src.github.io/oneAPI-samples/Tools/GPU-Occupancy-Calculator/](https://oneapi-src.github.io/oneAPI-samples/Tools/GPU-Occupancy-Calculator/)
* Select a GPU from the dropdown and change "EU Count" if necessary OR select
  the option to enter PCI ID for GPU.
* The tool will load some default values for Global Size, WG size, SG size,
  SLM size and will compute Occupancy and generate graphs.
* Change the values of GPU target, Global size, WG size, SG size, SLM size or
  Barrier usage based on your HPC application to calculate Occupancy and tune application.
